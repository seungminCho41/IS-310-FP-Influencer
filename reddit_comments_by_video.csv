I pressed very firmly on the hard plastic square in the center of the whistling cup (right for me) until I heard a faint click noise.

I started at 10:02am on a Sunday (this morning), and was finished before 10:30am. 

They wanted to know when I bought them. I told them the date, and Amazon. 

When did it start? I didn't notice this until about 2 weeks ago. 

When it is charging, is the light solid or blinking. Mine is solid. 

Have you reset or initialized them? I did the one at a time one, and the one where you touch both at the same time. (I could not remember the complete process for either, but what I did remember was enough for them to know I did both). 

They asked for shipping info, serial, and color. 

That was 10m ago, and I just got the email with a prepaid shipping label and instructions. I am getting an exchange, and from the email, ""The replacement will be a new unit of the same model.""

So I ordered the needed tools and a new battery (fake one from alibaba) and started to change the battery. After finishing the change and putting it back together I realized I just **CHANGED THE WRONG ONE**. FML...  
Worked just fine anyway, so no worries.  
As I have now the knowledge how to do it easily I **changed the correct** (right) one and **put in the original SONY battery** of the left one.

Unfortunately, there are a lot of inequalities when it comes to living in Latin America.  
Because of that, I'd like to ask anyone in any country that has been able to receive an official replacement from Sony even with an expired warranty could post any formal proof of that as we cannot get the same in Latin America. Anything helps: Papers, screenshots, etc.

I've had the same issue and I'm 1 month out of warranty after taking it on to the service center they want to charge me to replace the earbud. After 4 contacts and counting no success in getting Sony Latin America to acknowledge the issue. My hope is that the formal complaints with Consumer Protection will get them to listen.

SonyHeadphones,"So, I bought these earbuds a month or so after they were released and they're amazing, but as many here, I noticed a drastic decrease in battery life, for me when I upgraded to 2.0.0 was that things got really bad, where I would have 1:30h tops of battery. I put them to charge in the case (it was 100% at the time) and left it there for a couple of hours, when I got them back they were really hot, both buds had only around 80% battery and the case had only 17%, which is REALLY weird, since the case should have more than one charge.  


I kept using them and noticed that battery life was getting worse and worse. At one point I saw the case blinking red, which is the overheating warning, right?  


So I read this thread and saw about the RMA, which is not an option for me, I bought these buds in the USA and I live in Brazil, which doesn't have this product released (only the WH XM4 exists here), so I won't be able to do anything with them here.

However I spoke to one person a week or so ago who was utterly apologetic and told me to send them into the repair centre even though they were out of warranty. I asked if this advice would be recorded so I can refer to it if there were issues further down the line... stupidly l listened and sent them in.

  
Was given an estimate of £209.50 for the repair (£30 for a return of the product to me without repair!), I called through to express my surprise, and got a very unhelpful agent. I eventually asked to make a formal complaint and asked for a call back. I got it this morning. The person I spoke to actually acknowledged that the person who recommended I send it in did say that, but they had made a mistake. But they stated that all emails have a disclaimer that out of warranty repairs are subject to be paid for, as a get out of jail free card.

  
It's shocking that there is such varied responses to this issue around the globe. I eventually pleaded that the product be sent back to me free of charge and the agent said they would see if that's possible and would call me back tomorrow, I'm not holding my breath.  
I love the product but this experience has been a nightmare, I'm not sure I could ever buy another of their headphones again.",2022-11-28 11:16:49,3,2105,3255,0.99,Short_Nov2022,After
SonyHeadphones,"So, previously I wrote to my local Sony support(EU) and told them about this problem.

Then their answer was that an update is coming out by the end of the month.

Meanwhile I used the Downgrade tool to install 1.3.3(for me this did not make things better or worse)

Now yesterday I was asking if they have more information about the situation.

Their answer was:

>No, the new software should have been available a week ago. Currently not available to anyone, not even to Sony service. Unfortunately, we still have to wait.

Now I put on my tinfoil hat, and start worrying that there is more in there than just a software bug. My guess is that the damage is now permanent and they trying to mitigate the damage with new version but are not there yet.",2022-11-30 07:08:37,2,2105,3255,0.99,Short_Nov2022,After

SonyHeadphones,I've been stalking this thread for about 2 days now. I updated to 2.0 and it seems to have not fixed my issue so I'm assuming that the battery has unfortunately been cooked on my buds. I'm experiencing about 20 minutes on average on a full charge and then the buds will say the battery is low please recharge and then power off. After setting them back in the case and re-setting the case I'll get a jump from anywhere to 60%-80% though I just discovered this. The buds were getting extremely hot before the update (case flashing red ect) now they still get hot when charging but not to the point it hurts to touch them and the case no longer flashes red. I'm not sure if there is a fix that I'm able to. I have yet to try and contact support to see if I can get a replacement.

They claimed they replaced the earbuds at one point - which clearly wasn't true.  Finally they told me to contact the retailer I originally bought from to resolve the issue.

The retailer swapped them out in a few days.  Received the new unit over the weekend.  The production date is from January 2023.  They came with 1.6.2.  I upgraded to 2.0 immediately.  Been testing them for the last couple of days and so far everything is great.  

With ANC and Google assist off, the battery is fairly consistant (approx 2-3% off) for a solid 5-6 hours.  At this point, the right earbud was about 8-9% off.  They lasted around 8 hours.  Not experiencing any high heat issues when wireless charging either.  Let's hope it stays this way.

The features are better on the XM4 but that is mainly for quality of life (small things) and the essential features are available on the XM3.

HeadphoneAdvice,"I have the M4s and I really like them. The battery lasts forever for me—certainly much much longer than AirPods. 

Unfortunately, as with all over ears, their comfort will ultimately depend on the shape of your head and ears (and whether you wear glasses). I personally find that the M4s get uncomfortable only on my left side after extended wear. My habit of wearing them skewed so I can talk to my partner is probably to blame here. I also find that when I lay down with them on they slide around a bit. 

I’ll flag this: the M4s aren’t supposed to be worn when exercising or exposed to moisture. This is because there’s a sensor in the left earcup to detect whether they’re being worn. High moisture environments interfere with that sensor. I wear the M4s when exercising anyways, and have only noticed that when the headphones are sweaty the feature to automatically stop playing when you take off the headphones doesn’t work as well. 

If you want a lower price point, [these headphones](https://www.akg.com/Headphones/Over-ear%20%26%20On-ear/AKGY600NCBTBLK.html) are direct competitors to the M4s and are on deep discount. I don’t own them, so I can’t speak to their comfort, but they’re so cheap right now I might scoop them up despite already owning M4s.

HeadphoneAdvice,"> My AirPods recently died on me

Your AirPods Max, or the in-ear AirPods? If it's the Max, then you had the best noise canceling performance with those cans. Sound performance is pretty good too.

The XM3 and XM4 are close to the Max in terms of noise canceling performance, but not quite the same. Don't get me wrong, they are very good, better than a lot of cans out there, but Max is simply the top performer.

In terms of sound quality, the XM4 are close to the Max. The XM4 are also cheaper.

The XM4 are more lightweight than the Max. Whether that translates into better comfort is hard to say - this is a very personal issue. I would not go running with the Max (just commuting is fine), but with the XM4 running might be doable. Careful with sweat, it may do things to the device that you don't want done.

I've used all of the above in the office and for walking around the neighborhood.

If you can still find an XM3 brand new somewhere, that might be a great deal. Their NC performance is virtually identical to the XM4. They sound a bit more bassy than the XM4, which they didn't really need to, but some folks like that sound.

Comfort is a subjective topic. What is feathertouch comfortable to me might be a torture chamber for you.",2023-03-24 19:02:52,1,11,19,0.79,Short_Mar2023,After

XM5s don't fold up so they're going to take up more space in your bag.

HeadphoneAdvice,"ANC should be called “noise reducing” instead. Active noise reduction/reducing would be the more accurate description. 

My Etymotic ER4SR with the triple flange tips block more noise than anything noise canceling I’ve used. This would be passive noise reduction/reducing similar to ear plugs. Because of how they block the ear canal with the triple flange tips, and the sealed body of the IEMs themselves they will do more to block noise than any currently available “ANC” headphone or “ANC” IEM. 

But anyway, expect ANC to dull most constant sounds.

Its one thing to come to these subs for advice, but try not to let some comments get to you and cause buyers remorse.

HeadphoneAdvice,"To directly answer your question: from a consumer perspective, they sound great. 

The XM4's are decent, don't worry about it. If you like the sound of the HyperX, you'll find the XM4's even better, I'm sure. There are better sounding headphones for the money, but not necessarily a life or death difference between them. The XM4's make up a lot of their value in features. They have an app, they're wireless, noise cancelling, touch controls, all that. At the end of the day, they do a lot more and still sound good, but of course they don't sound as good as a wired pair of Sennheiser's or some such that *only* sound good. 

Basically what I'm saying is, I think it'll be just fine for you, and an improvement in sound quality at that, and at the end of the day, they still do way more than a somewhat better sounding set. 

They're very consumer oriented headphones, and so if you look at a lot of audiophile reviews/opinions, you'll hear people talk bad about them. Look at consumer reviewers though (ie CNET or another such reviewing site) and they'll be praised to the heavens for their sound. For the most part it's opinions, so if you like the sound they have then that's all that really matters. Don't get too full of buyer's regret or anything like that, they're excellent headphones overall. If you do think you'd prefer something that sounds better even with less features, I can try to give you some recommendations, but really I think the XM4's will be good for you.",2021-01-11 23:52:09,10,23,30,1.0,Long_Dec2020,After

XM4 for versatility. I’m not a fan of the sound as they’re massively mid bass forward, but they can be EQ to taste. They aren’t sweat resistant. So I don’t know about the gym. They’re significantly better for travel. You also have versatility in charging and with the 3.5mm jack. 

Max sounds amazing, but they’re definitely not as portable, nor are they sweat resistant. They’re also prone to QC issues. I used mine solely at home or when on my lunch break at work. To use wired you must have a special (extra cost) cable that only Apple sells.

HeadphoneAdvice,"To answer your questions. 

Many over ear wireless headphones have wired options. That’s mainly for latency with visual media. There are no wired headphones that have ANC, just the passive cancellation that pads and closed back gives. 

For your second question 

Closed back is exactly what it sounds like. A closed cup. This is common on wireless headphones as you want the isolation so you don’t hear the outside and people don’t hear your music like what open back has. 

As far as suggestions in that range. 

Take a look at the AKG n700nc MkII. The noise cancellation won’t be as good as the Sony, but the tuning will be better. 

Another option is the Anker Soundcore Q45. Another one that ANC won’t be as good as the Sony, but will be tuned better. And their app is pretty awesome so you can tweak the sound a lot. 

As far as sleeping, I don’t sleep with headphones on, so I can’t advise on that.

headphones,"As a WH-1000XM2 user (but bought on clearance), the XM3's and XM4's are really such minor upgrades that it's a joke to call them a new product.

I'm not audiophile so my XM2's sound good enough for me, but **there are SO MANY QoL/features these (and other) headphones in this category are missing out on.**

USB-C should work as both data AND power AND at the same time. With 3.5mm obviously being there as a choice.

Offer some form of low latency wireless sound. Whether it's AptX Adaptive (AptX LL is EoL), or a WiFi based dongle (like gaming headsets offer). $300+ wireless headphones aren't solely for music, so latency matters!

Make the mics usable! No, no, I'm not talking about quality, I'm talking about the fact that like NONE of these traveler headphones let you use the mics when in an form of a wired mode.

Make the batteries accessible! They don't have to be easily accessible to hot swap or anything, but don't glue every part of the headphones including the battery in place. Because these devices have a battery they have a lifespan before they die, don't force owners to toss out a quality device simply because it's 5 years old.

Multi-point/connection BT that works, it's 2020, if my $30 Chinese wireless earbuds can do it, Sony can to.

I'm not sure if this still applies but my XM2's are designed in such a way that they don't work with most headphone cables, support what actually exists Sony, don't just hit the 3.5mm jack spec and not actually test it with other cables.

Software updates should never worsen a product. If you're going to make changes that compromise what already exists (ANC...) update the device but make it an option in the app, don't just pull an Apple or Bose and tell users to deal with it.

I have the XM2s and have mostly been underwhelmed. The sound is ok, but the ear cups are so shallow the drivers rub my cartilage and make them sore after an hour.

The noise calibration doesn't pause the audio you're playing, so it takes 15-20s to activate and complete, then you realize you missed out on audio. How is Sony so bad at UX? They never use their own products?

The lack of multi-point BT is absurd. I use these to listen to: phone, laptop, Apple TV. And if I had a tablet, that's a 4th device. Let me cycle through these!

How can wind noise sound so familiar in tone and predictable in pattern but nobody can use clever ML/AI to filter this out? Or even road noise if you leave near a freeway or train noise. 

This is where I expect Apple to wipe the floor with other brands. Their HomePod already samples many times a second to know how to fire the tweeters based on proximity of objects, right? And I bet they can sample other nearby headphones—like many passengers on the same train car—for ambient noise to filter out.

headphones,"They're good headphones.  I'm mainly an IEM fellow myself, so I don't go out of my way for headphones.  But the Drop 6XX config is cheap for a 650 with barebones packaging.  At this price point, it's a competitive buy and performs strong at that price mark.  I picked up a pair recently.  I also wanted a suitable headphone arena reference as a reference point in the headphone space.

Key things that stand out:

They're colored and not geared for neutral, natural sound.  As far as I've read, the 600 is better for this, but the 600 vs 650 is a decision of trade offs.  Plus one can always EQ out the coloration.

The soundstage is small.  This is a byproduct of its forward presentation.  It doesn't do delicacy/subtlety well.  It's a hard thing to do right and many products can't or do this poorly.  A really good soundstage is hard to achieve, and it's rare to find products that have good linearity and proper range from close intimacy to distant details and everything in between.  Maybe 1 out of every 25 good products do this really well.  Still with that said, the 650 is moderately small and far more in-head than spacious, more so than I was expecting.  Open back = spacious sound right?  No.  Not really.

They have excellent level of detail, however a bit subtle about it.  There's a lot of information there and quite resolving.  The subtlety of it is that it presents detail in a somewhat laid back way, not edgy, not aggressive.  The headphone has a thick foam pad over the driver.  I assume the does two things.  One, it caters to the warmer sound.  Two, it might muffle some of the sharper detail.  Filter use in the IEM world is common for tuning a variety of aspects.  I'd expect no different from the headphone world.  I have yet to pull the foam filter out to test (if I even can non-destructively), but I think this may help both tonality and fine detail on this headphone, just as long as you're ok with a less forgiving level of detail.  I'm used to IEMs which are almost always faster and edgier anyways, so for me, the detail and speed is dulled a little versus many IEMs.

Overall, the intent of the 650 seems to be geared to cater towards a larger audience.  Is warmer with a bit of a high bass bump.  Is forgiving to high frequency sensitivity and lower bitrate sources.  It offers high level of detail without being aggressive. These are desirable traits for most people.  I suspect the goal was a more inviting solution than the 600.  Is also overall a pretty high level of fidelity.  I can argue aspects about character above, but in the end, it's still quite good.  And at the Drop 6XX price, it can be had for a good value.

But...I still like IEMs better. :p",2023-04-01 04:25:31,2,144,84,0.95,Short_Mar2023,After

For me they're really the sweet spot both in terms of price to performance ratio, but also neutral/accurate enough to be reference quality whilst being slightly laid back enough to be enjoyable for extended listening sessions. The build quality is also incredible and they're very comfortable to wear.

They also scale pretty nicely with higher end amplification. I've heard them being driven by everything from phone jacks to high end tube amps. They sound good with just about everything, but you can squeeze a bit more performance out of them with better gear.

The only cons are the soundstage is a little flat, and they're a little bass light for some genres. 

Are they endgame, probably not for me (that's electrostats), but if you're ""into the hobby"" they're pretty much a classic, and I'd say an essential that everyone should own or at least experience.

These are awfully close to the Koss despite being closed back, the space afforded by the large, deep earcups makes for a surprisingly wide sound. Out of the box these are way warmer sounding due to the heavy bass though.

Tip if you want to tone that bass down: turn off the listening optimizer function in the app (leave listening care on though). While listening optimizer is supposed to adjust the sound based on how the headphones fit around your ears, I find it overcompensates with extra bass boost when it determines the seal isn't quite right (even though the fit comfortably around my giant ears :D)

With this off, the bass is still full but no longer over-powering the mids/treble like before.
