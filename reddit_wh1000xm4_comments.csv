THE ANC is fantastic. It makes the cars passing by in a bus station feel like you’re hearing them from that distance between barely able to hear them and unable to hear or see them. The sound quality if you are critical of the sound of your music is fine. There is no stereo separation so all instruments will sound like they are coming from one place and kind of muddy the music, making it sound less clear.

Ease of use, comfort, portability, and top of the class noise cancelation.

Look after them try to avoid getting too much moisture on them, they will make you sweat if training or using them in hot climates, definitely would, remember that they are mainly made out of plastic with metal inserts, not “vibranium” as some user seem to think they are, keep in the case if not using them for a lengthy period and they’ll last you well and sound great.",2024-03-18 19:41:00,After

SonyHeadphones,Is the WH-1000XM4 still worth it in 2024?,"YES. I bought mine after testing SONYXM5, SONYXM4s, SONY XB910n extra bass, SONY ULT WEAR, SONY WCH-720N and AIRPOD MAXS. And I’m happy with my decision. The noise cancellation is GREAT and I feel isolated when it’s turned on. The controls for are also a plus as you can range between numbers on how much noise you want cancelled. Also the touch controls are something I wasn’t sure if I was gonna like but it’s kind of cool. The BASS is my favorite part. You can literally feel the music and that was a big selling point for me. I was stuck between the xb910n and ULT WEAR, and airpod max. The XM4s are the most comfortable out of all listed and it’s folding ability is another pro( the airpod max ad XM5s don’t fold) . One thing I was scared I was gonna miss out on in the Apple ecosystem is the seamless Bluetooth switch or whatever that’s called where it will switch your airpod to whatever device your currently using but I prefer Sonys system better. When switching with AirPods it would switch automatically and it was very annoying but with my XM4s it will connect to two devices at once so it will not switch automatically.  If you play media one the first device and start playing media from the second device it will continue to play music from the first device.  For it to switch you need to you pause the media on the first device then play media on the second then it will seamlessly play audio from the second device. Which I really favor over apples automatic switching that will stop the media from the first device as soon as you play media    On the second (I watch movies on my laptop and sometimes watch videos on my phone so that is why it bothered me). Another thing I like about the XM4s and SONY brand period is the app controls. The equalizer really allows you to control the sound of your music so if you’re not too heavy on bass you can tweak or if you want to watch a movie and focus on the dialogue you can change the setting. THE XM5s sounded a little flat to me in comparison to the XM4s, ULT wear when it came to bass. And the airpod maxs also seemed to lack that vibrating bass the XM4s offer. The WCH-720 sounded cheap compared to everything else but they’re probably a good budget option. The XB910ns and ULT WEAR were good next to the XM4s but I opted for the XM4s for the updated technology and design/style.",2024-10-25 10:02:29,After

SonyHeadphones,WH-1000XM4 - Any recommendations from experienced owners to a new user?,"The equalizer is your friend. A lot of people here ask for recommended settings but truthfully the nature of this stuff is subjective and the best possible advice anyone can give you is to just fuck around and find out until you reach a sound signature that you prefer. I personally did download Poweramp by recommendation of some users here and I did find that to be helpful alongside the equalizer that Sony offers in their companion app. I also did have to turn off Dolby Atmos, as the only thing I really ever used that equalizer for was to increase my phone's volume. 

Don't lose or dump the case. Yes, there are enough stories about lost cases. 

Don't work out with them. These aren't workout headphones. They're not water resistant. The moisture build up will bite you in the ass down the line. 

Have realistic expectations. Noise cancelling isn't designed to completely kill all background noise. It's designed to manage continuous frequency noises. If someone is talking to you or near you, you will be able to hear it. If you're outside and something heavy falls near you or something really loud passes you really fast, you will hear it. It'll all be muffled due to the passive sealing, but you'll still be able to hear it to some degree. The best way to kill background noise is to play some music along with the NC turned on.

The minute I step onto public transport, boom full noise cancelation.

You can have dual connection, but not with LDAC though.

In the app, disable speak to chat, it's the most annoying feature and it gets re-enabled every update. This is crucial if you are doing Teams meetings on BT, since as soon as you talk, ALL audio from the meeting gets muted. 
If you are going to use it with a PS5, XBox, or wired to computer, you probably want a V-Moda Boom Pro. The 3.5 cable included disables the mic. I have both versions of the boom pro and either is fine, so I recommend grabbing whichever is cheapest.

Sound is great, ANC is great (mostly blocks static, voices, laughter etc can be heard through, with music on at about 30% volume you can also block those and hear nothing in a busy train for example).

You wil want to disable the ""headset"" device on PCs, as the ANC and audio quality go to shit as soon as you open the mic (just use another mic).

SonyHeadphones,WH-1000XM4 High Pitched Noise in Left Ear Cup When Partially Lifted,"Sorry for bumping this old thread, but I have a few items I'd like to add to this.  I do not have a definite solution, but I have made a few observations. 

At first, I noticed that turning the headphones off and back on would buy me a little time before it would start again.  Then, I found this thread and a few similar on the Sony forums that mentioned the microphone in the left ear cup.  I took it apart and did a thorough cleaning.  For the most part, it was all clean, except for the little black cloth(?) disk that covered the silver mic.  I found that if I didn't get the black disk centered in place, the whining would come back almost instantly, versus buying a little time if it was in place.  I don't know how that makes sense, but it was a small observation.

&#x200B;

I connected the headphones to my phone and updated to the latest software.  That didn't seem to have any effect on the whining...still there.  BUT, the biggest effect I observed was going into the app and turning off Ambient Sound Control.  The whining went away completely.  That, of course, kinda defeats the purpose, but at least allowed them to function without bursting an ear drum.

&#x200B;

So, I started experimenting and found that if you turned on Ambient Sound Control, but reduced the sensitivity (I think), you can find a sweet spot.  I noticed if I drop it down one notch, it would still whine, but two notches would be stop it completely.  I have it set at ""Ambient Sound 1"", with ""Focus on Voice"" disabled.  This makes them almost as good as new.  I hate that I have to do this with a $300 pair of headphones, but at least they are usable now.

&#x200B;

I bought a set of replacement cushions that add a little distance between the speakers and my ears, in the hope that my ear wax will take longer to muck it up.  I also bought some microphone replacements from AliExpress, but just went by size, and I ordered before I noticed these app settings, so I'm torn on whether I actually replace the microphone myself, or just keep changing the setting via the app.

&#x200B;

Now that I've notice the ANC app settings make the most difference, I'm wondering what everybody else notices and if that's a decent solution for people.  I'd like to hear from others about it.",2023-01-17 05:40:25,Before

This little “door” was held on by some sort of gasket that came loose on mine. Seems like this may be a door to access the mic?

Hello guys, I had this issue for a while now and tested all fixes I found, it seems that as mentioned, the issue is caused by humidity and non efficient covering of the microphone. To be honest, i tested every fix mentioned and what worked, worked temporally and then the issue reoccured.

I managed to fix the issue in its totality by changing the earpads of the XM4s alongside the sponges that go inside. I noticed the old sponges were thin and had a lot of holes in it (most probably due to humidity usage) Since i changed the earpads and the sponges, the headphones had worked without doing any buzzing or loud hiss.

Hope this helps someone :)",2024-02-13 16:41:41,After
SonyHeadphones,WH-1000XM4 High Pitched Noise in Left Ear Cup When Partially Lifted,"Hello.  For me, the squeaking problem occurred after more than a year.  A few days ago.  I came across this topic.  I took apart the right earpiece in my case.  I took off the rubber securing the ANC microphone and gently pulled it out.  I cleaned everything gently with alcohol sticks.  the microphone too.  I put it back together.  The problem will go away.  I will add that it was humid around the microphone.  I also moved the speaker diaphragm a little prophylactically.  I'm testing now.  I will let you know when the problem comes back.

EDIT; 

welcome back.  the headphones worked after cleaning inside 2 weeks and started to engage again.  I took them to the sony technical service.  It turned out that, unfortunately, the ANC microphones got wet.  it is caused by excessive use with wet ears.  and have failed over time.  The service technician pointed out that after an intense effort, e.g. in the gym or bathing, you should not put them on immediately.  Put the headphones back after use so that moisture from the earcups can evaporate and not boil inside the earcup.  I ended up replacing the two ANC microphones and cleaning and drying the PCBs.

SonyHeadphones,WH-1000XM4 High Pitched Noise in Left Ear Cup When Partially Lifted,"Y'all, I went a little more in-depth with the teardown and I think I might have a more thorough solution.

Removing the muff and foam reveals a small grey rubber cover. Take that off, and you get the ANC microphone. You will probably see some yellowish earwax-looking gunk. Pin the thought.

Carefully remove the microphone from its cylindrical friction mount, and you'll see a fabric/papery cover over the top. This filter is attached to the microphone with a small ring of glue.

It seems that moisture from use loosens that glue and turns it goopy and allows it to flow a little. I suspect the filter has become slightly saturated in the goop which could change how it filters sound waves.

I'm going to soak the paper filters and rubber covers in isopropyl. I wouldn't recommend putting alcohol on the microphones themselves though.

You'll have to be more delicate with reassembly without the glue holding the filter onto the mic face. Once it's in it should stay in though.

UPDATE: The whine is fully fixed. Without the glue, the mics and filters have a tiny bit of play in their housing. The grey rubber keeps the filter from falling out but there are intermittent clicks in ANC mode from the mics hitting their housings. Small bits of clay or tape or paper or \*something\* to hold the microphones firmly should fix this.",2024-04-17 22:58:06,After

This along with the static and crackling that occurs with audio when connected to to my samsung smart tv has led me to unfortunatley concluding that i have to return them for the bose.

SonyHeadphones,WH-1000XM4 High Pitched Noise in Left Ear Cup When Partially Lifted,"I think this is a hardware issue. I think what's happening is we all have accidentally put too much pressure on the respective ear cup at some point, and it's caused some piece of equipment inside the cup that's related to Ambient Sound Control/Noise Canceling to break or be displaced and that is causing it to emit an incredibly unpleasant feedback.

That is likely why some have allegedly fixed the issue (either permanently or temporarily) by pressing really hard on the cup. But simultaneously, that is also why I don't think anyone should attempt that """"""fix,"""""" because doing that is probably far more likely to just make the problem even worse.

I don't think much can be done other than invoking the warranty for a new pair, taking it to a repairman to Crack open the cup, figure out wtf is going on with the 'phones (or doing it yourself), or just giving up on the noise-canceling function. ;_;

Incidentally, there is this little bump in the middle of each ear-cup, just on the other side of the fabric, this little piece of the equipment that feels like a small rounded bump; and I've noticed that pressing on that often causes the feedback screech to go off, so I'm pretty sure whatever tf that thing is, it's what's broken or fucking up and causing L'Squreeçhé.",2022-01-31 08:45:46,Before

1. Remove the ear pad. You can follow this guide: https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Sony+WH-1000XM4+Ear+Pads+Replacement/143667

2. Remove the foam underneath the ear pad. It shouldn't be attached in any way, so you can just lift it off.

3. There should be a gray piece covering a silver disc. If it came off, that may be causing the issue. You can just place it back on. It looks like this: https://imgur.io/a/ysYNacY

SonyHeadphones,WH-1000XM4 High Pitched Noise in Left Ear Cup When Partially Lifted,"1) my experience is consistent with this being a ANC feedback problem; it goes away immediately when I turn off ANC.

2)  it usually happens on the R for me, but if it is an ANC feedback problem, both sides are equipped the same for this function and equally susceptible, so far as we know, aside from any unintended asymmetry of ANC affected engineering, construction, or software; like any feedback problem, it starts small and builds.  I usually can hear it coming in time to press the 'custom' button which I've configured (using the Sony headset software) to disable the ANC.

3) it often goes away if I can stand it long enough to press on R ear cup; this is consistent with hypotheses that problem is aggravated by sound leaking around older cup as cushions begin flatten with age, or with poorly seating ear cushions, or conceivably, some centrally located mic or speaker element that is dampened by the contact/pressure that results.

4) it began after 18 months, and 6 months after I started working out (Zwift force-feedback exercise bike) with headset on - consistent with moisture hypothesis perhaps, but seems it is slow to dry and self cure, since I've had months of workout hiatus during a very dry winter (temps -13F -25C) and no cure for the screech tho also at that time is was still infrequent. Although it is possible that it is merely moisture; seems more likely that (in addition, sometimes) body debris/sweat residual would be consistent with those who found cleaning helped - I noted that, despite efforts to keep workout sweat from inside the cups (I wear headband and bandana), that there was evidence that oils from my ears had darkened the central fabric/foam area on a timeframe consistent with onset of this ANC feedback screech - there have been times I've slept on my side wearing headset and so the inside of the cup would have been against my ear.  I haven't tried cleaning yet; will day after tomorrow when ...

5) new thicker 'Wicked' cushions specific for Sony's XM4 will arrive; I will clean as I replace the cushions.

6) Tangent: from about 14 months after purchase, I have been unable to charge the headset normally; I found others online with similar problem; the work-around is to turn headset off. Then, turn it on and at about  the time the blue light comes on (\~1-2 seconds?), connect the TypeC USB charging cable.  My concern: it would be a simple matter for any high tech company to engineer failure times post warrantee expiry into the software or updates, in a 'randomly' distributed way to assure that no good business is ever undercut by its own durable success.  Suspected this more on the charging issue than on this one, but such a business strategy is not well monitored or controlled - and would be rather difficult to do.  Suspect 1 in 100  or fewer high tech criminals are caught.

so: 1) turn off ANC (either pre-emptively, reduce its intensity, or upon indication of ANC feedback starting, almost surely this will stop feedback; almost surely your ANC feature goes away, 2) get thicker cushions, 3) clean speaker, mic, fabric/foam cup interior, 4) attend to small details of mic assembly as you disassemble for cleaning, 5) try to dry mic/speaker elements (alcohol, heat, etc), 6) get a new one and swap parts one by one.",2023-08-20 05:46:13,After

&#x200B;

This is a funny issue, by that I mean this makes the headset a massive unusable piece of trash until you fix it. I am so sad that this sort of issue just stays unfixed from such a large company, the ONLY thread about this is seemingly here on reddit and the fix is hard to apply, sony itself seems to act as if it's not an issue and is just ignoring it until they make more newer headsets.

&#x200B;

I feel like the correct response to this should be to reach out to all owners of their headsets and offer free repairs/returns until they fix it in software, since it really seems like a mic feedback situation that could be solved in software possible, and hey if not then release a fix to permanently disable the mic.

SonyHeadphones,WH-1000XM4 High Pitched Noise in Left Ear Cup When Partially Lifted,"Pressing the cup didn't work for me, but I found this little guide explaining what the issue might be, and how to fix it posted as an Amazon review of all things (full credit goes to **sallysings**, who reviewed the product in Canada on July 10, 2023): 

> You don't need this review to tell you how the sound quality is etc. What I'm here to tell you is that, EVENTUALLY, in maybe 6 months, maybe a year, maybe just two months out of warranty, THIS WILL HAPPEN. This is about how to fix it if it's out of warranty.

> You will get feedback in one ear. It will quickly get to maximum volume, and it will hurt your ear if you don't take them off real quick. (Honestly, Sony, I smell class-action lawsuit. There really should be a warning: if you start getting a low-pressure feeling in the noise cancelling, it is a sign of MOISTURE BUILDUP.) How quickly this starts happening depends completely on your activity level or if there's a heatwave or if you live in Canada and condensation happens. A lot.

> Here's how to fix it: take a butter knife and slip it in between the ear pads and the cups. It will click as they come off -- don't worry, they're meant to be replaced. Once you open it up you will see a gray rubber nub holding the mic in place. Remove the nub, and GENTLY lift the mic out of the black plastic casing. Pull off the black pad with your fingers or tweezers (it's held in place with glue, but should slide off).

> Now put a hairdryer to that mic. Just the mic -- the plastic drivers under it can be melted if you apply too much heat to the whole thing. Or do like I did and stick it next to the laptop vent and play something GPU demanding. You need heat and dry air. After 45 minutes, put everything back into place, and there should be no more feedback.

> May your ANC headphones last you for years. This happens because moisture makes the mic less sensitive, and the software will overcompensate. Thus the BEEEEEEEEEP in your ear.",2023-10-01 14:41:27,After

SonyHeadphones,WH-1000XM4 High Pitched Noise in Left Ear Cup When Partially Lifted,"I have XM5, I tried pushing in the small thing but I was little scared about it, so I removed the cushions to see what I was pushing on, it is indeed a mic with Lil plastic over it, but pushing on it is not what worked for me, the sound is indeed a feedback loop, and there are only 2 ways to remove that

1. Take mic far from the speaker (can't really do this XD)
2. Make the system recalibrate, meaning hard reset your damn headphones, system will acknowledge the high pitch then

My guess is the reason why that pushing worked for some, is because that plastic was Lil out, and mic was picking up something extra and restoring it to orginal place fixed it, I would recommend removing the cushions to be sure you are not breaking anything, also first try a hard reset, give your headphones time to adjust it's shit.",2023-10-06 06:20:14,After

SonyHeadphones,WH-1000XM4 High Pitched Noise in Left Ear Cup When Partially Lifted,"Apparently the microphones gather up some junk over time and this starts causing the ANC to go haywire.

What worked for me:

* disassembled the ear cups, removed the rubber mic boots, and took out the mics
* removed the fabric covering the mics and rubbed the body clean with denatured alcohol
* took a syringe and flushed the mics with denatured alcohol several times and finished off with IPA just in case, probably unnecessary step  
Did the flushing over a small dish with the mic hanging over the side of the ear cup so the liquids don't get into the frame.
* used a q-tip to try and remove any leftover liquid by just putting it against the grille of the mic and holding it there for a while
* soaked the cover fabrics in denatured alcohol for a while, took them out and rubbed them with a q-tip on both sides to clean
* let everything evaporate for a while and reassembled everything - didn't bother gluing the fabric in place, it should be fine once the rubber cover is replaced
* profit!

In my case it did quietly crackle a bit after assembly in one ear but it stopped in a little while.I only had whistling in the right ear but after fixing that the left one started whining so it's probably sensible to do them both while you're at it. And you can test without reassembling it just try to make sure it's reasonably dry before you do.",2023-10-20 18:26:19,After

Until I was reading the comments on a youtube post that mentioned something about a mic dust filter. Lo and behold right on the bottom of the little disc mic theirs a tiny circular black filter, I took it out and saw it was totally gunked up with wax. I scrubbed it clean with 99% alcohol, put it back on the mic and popped it in not expecting it to work and BOOM IT DID.

SonyHeadphones,WH-1000XM4 High Pitched Noise in Left Ear Cup When Partially Lifted,"I've had these headphones for around three years and ran into the same problem mentioned here, with the left earcup acting up. In my situation, lifting the earcup stopped the tone but it blasted when fully on my head. I tried all the good suggestions people suggested here and elsewhere online, but none worked except turning off ANC, and what's the point of that? 

Eventually, I had to send them to Sony's recommended service provider, (the only one) in Syracuse, NY, 3000 miles from me. The whole repair process took two weeks and set me back $149.39 USD, covering the labor, parts, and shipping. They replaced the Feedback Microphones and gave me a six-month warranty on the repair, so I'm crossing my fingers that these headphones will last a few more years as now I'm into them for a total of almost $600 bucks. That aside, I have been really pleased with them all this time for their comfort, sound quality, and noise canceling.

But yeah, Sony really dropped the ball by not giving people a heads-up about that loud tone potential when one of the feedback mics goes south. It was seriously harsh, and could've done some real damage to my ears if I hadn't reacted quickly. 

Anyway, [UnitedRadio.com](https://UnitedRadio.com) actually did a solid job. Even though I wasn't thrilled about coughing up the cash for repairs, their service was on point – clear communication, fair pricing (for what it's worth these days), and a decently quick turnaround. I'm just keeping my fingers crossed that these headphones don't crap out the day after the warranty expires.

This whole thing's got me thinking twice about sticking with Sony next time I need new headphones. I might check out Bose, especially since I'm pretty happy with one of their soundbars. But hopefully, that won't be for a while.",2024-01-27 21:09:55,After

Bass is nerfed, mids and highs raised. Sound has got closer to Sennheiser than Sony, they do not sound similar to my good old wf-1000xm3 anymore. Feels like new pair of cans.

On the bright side (literally sound has got BRIGHT) it became much clearer and attenuated, almost to the point when its a bit harsh on highs, nothing critical though. Not just mellow and all-the-same-plain as it was before. Not to say I didn't enjoy it before but now I can finally tell the difference in mastering of two different songs — some could become worse as the consequence, but it is actually feels more true and honest. 

After turning mids and highs a bit down, and seting Xtra bass to +3 I dedinetely enjoy it more. 

To summ it up - I'd rather not update if I was in my twenties - I might not enjoy mid-high raise. If you are 30+ like me and your hearing bacame not so sharp - worth a try, but be prepared to tinker with EQ a bit.

 I bring this up as type C chargers and devices communicate on how much current is needed on the device so the charger can properly provide the requested amount. The issue arises when using cables that either have the wrong resistor or non at all. This issue was brought up when manufacturers flooded the market with these bad cables when the standard was first released. Without the right amount of resistance on certain lines the charger is unaware when a device is unplugged so when another one is plugged in it continues to provide the same level of power it was before.

SonyHeadphones,So my Wh-1000xm4 literally exploded while charging,"Mine did the exact same thing. They still work and charge but there is oem parts on eBay where you can get the complete internals for both sides and have brand new speakers and charging port again. I've put both my wh xm4s through hell. They say they are not water resistant but I am constantly in very damp and in either a caustic mist or acid mist. Both pairs last led almost 2000 hours and the only reason they stopped was because my puppy got ahold of both pairs and destroyed thema year almost to the day apart. I just bought the WH xm5s and the noise cancelling is so extremely weird but also truly incredible. Firstly they made the noise canceling truly active and it listens to noises around and accommodates the outside noise level. The louder the environment you are in the more powerful the noise canceling is, in quiet places the ANC seems to barely work however it most definitely is. I work around 120-decibel machines and air blowers. All I can hear is a low hum while I wear the xm5s and even calls go through flawlessly and people can hear me clearly without going outside. I work in a brewery packaging hall and on average we have 90 to 140 decibel machines that without hearing protection it literally hurts after just minutes of being around them. These headphones have blown me away with how much the actually upgraded from the xm4s.",2023-10-13 04:05:41,After

I just hanged with the escalation team from Sony and they said that since my WF1000XM4 are off warranty, I must pay for the service work. I told them over the phone why I should pay for something Sony broke? Before the 2.1.0. upgrade they were working fine and now my left bud disconnects for milliseconds, even next to my Android/iPhone/laptop device.

Basically they told me that since this out of warranty, I must paid for the repair. And I know they will not repair nothing, they will change them because the firmware damaged the units.

I told the lady over the phone that she is actually implicitly telling me that if a Sony device goes off warranty, I should NEVER perform any upgrades! I told her that Apple would change my devices for free, even off warranty as soon as they recognize Apple did a damage to my hardware. Sony is willing to loose a client because something they damaged!

Sony told me they haven't heard nor see any complains because if this update, so guys, please call Sony, use the chat form the page and then escalate, they will give you a case# and then a phone to call. Call, complain and that will be registered, won't matter if your device is out of warranty, just create the case so they start to work on a fix!",2024-12-12 20:00:50,After

I use Airpods at the gym, while exercising, or while walking outside. The adjustable noise cancellation and transparency mode are PERFECT for being in public.

The XM4s I use while getting work done, leisurely listening, or just generally while Im about home or at a desk somewhere. Their quality and ANC are superior. However, I personally don't like the idea of sweating with a full headphone on.

O-t-e headphones just envelop your whole ear and lock them in a way earbuds cannot possibly do. I was using the Samsung galaxy buds + for a while and always thought they sounded really darn good.

Except, you know, anything going over bluetooth is inherently lossy, because bluetooth doesn't have enough throughput to transmit lossless audio.

What I believe is happening here, is that the non-""lossless"" apple music subscription quality is just low quality compression and / or low bitrate. With apple lossless you're re-encoding on your device in higher quality than whatever standard apple music sends.

SonyHeadphones,Should I get the WH-1000XM4 or WH-CH720N,"I have both the 720n and XM4. The battery life of both is good so I would not worry in that regard.

The 720n beat the XM4 in comfort IMO. They are unbelievably light and comfortable - I can wear them for hours at a time. However, they do not fold up (they only fold flat) and do not come with a carrying case. If you want a carrying case for them, you will have to buy that separately. Amazon does sell carrying cases specifically for them though. The sound is good for casual listening and the noise cancelling is decent, but not great.

The XM4 have a more premium build quality, better noise cancelling and better sound quality - as you would probably expect given the price difference. They also come with a carrying case and can fold up for storage in the case. However, I do not find them as comfortable as the 720n.

If you are on a budget and don't want to spend as much - and don't mind the less premium build quality and the fact that they don't come with a carrying case - then the 720n are a solid choice. I would suggest getting a case for them though if you plan on taking them out with you.

Both headphones are great picks but are at different price points. I think you would be happy with either of them - it just depends if you think the more premium aspects of the XM4 are worth the extra money over the 720n. I hope this helps you decide which one to get.",2025-03-21 06:59:58,After

If you don't value sound quality, but want most of XM4's functionality for a lower price, you can get ULT Wear. ULT don't have such nice materials and build quality as XM4, but you get additional bass functionalities.

Generally Sony has a problem with build quality and durability. So if that is also an important factor, maybe you should consider other vendors. For me comfort+ANC+durability = Bose QC, which should be available in similar price as XM4.",2025-03-21 08:10:25,After

headphones,These €22 earbuds just ruined my Sony WH-1000XM4 for me.,"My experience with them weren't actually all that great. Truly unfortunate considering how much potential these have. Here are my main gripes in order of priority:   
  
1. The fit is terrible, particularly in the left ear, can't go a couple minutes without adjusting it (honestly my problem, I'm just weird like that, few IEMs fit my ears very well, but this one in particular is atrocious, tried all the tips too🤣)

2. The battery is pretty bad, can barely watch a long movie without running out of juice, so you better hope you had it fully charged (like Endgame for example)

3. The case is pretty finnicky, especially getting the buds in and out. (occasionally causes drops)

4.  Pretty much nitpicking at this point, but the sound quality is overhyped, even when I do get a good seal by literally holding the left bud in place (yes, only $25 and expectations vs reality, but it truly isn't all that special, although there isn't really anything wrong with it. Although, I will say that many IEMs go for a similar tuning, particularly with the relaxed lower treble compared to Harman IE 2019, following closely with Crinacle's IEF neutral, so I can't say it's bad for the $25 it costs. However, to my ears at least, that makes drums sound a little dead, and don't have their strong initial attack, in Billie Jean for example, making them sound blunted). 

So overall, it's not a bad IEM, especially with all the features and decent sound at $25, even competing with its wired counterparts, but at least for me, it's basically unusable because of the fit. The other small issues do add up as well, so your mileage may vary, even if they do fit you well. That said, compared to the WH-1000XM4, at least in terms of sound, these definitely blow them out of the water, so if they work well for you, enjoy them!

The Sony XM4 is exactly like the XM3 internally except that it uses plugs instead of directly soldered cables. This means that if the hinge breaks, anyone can open it up and replace the hinge. Many of the parts of the XM4 are interchangable with the XM3 so this increases accessibility to replacement components. Despite being fully plastic, I really think it's the best in terms of affordability and value.  


To be honest, it bothers me that the Bose QuietComfort Ultras are the only model of noise canceling headphone that actually takes the problem with broken hinges seriously.

Most of the more expensive options waste their engineering doing pointless things like trying to create clarity, fast bass, good soundstage and other rubbish instead of filling all of their sonic budget on bass. 


But on a serious note. Both of those are rather bassy sets. The issue with such imbalance is that it misses the smaller details that musicians spend a lot of time polishing into their music. And getting that balance right is a lot harder than it sounds. So if you really want to enjoy more expensive headphones, try listening to some diversity in genres.

headphones,"Sony WH-1000XM4, repaired and given a new lease on life.","I purchased these Sony XM4s a few weeks back from Mercari - they were very broken and very gross. I thought they would be a pretty simple repair- new hinge and new headband.

Upon getting them, I realized pretty quickly that the previous owner had decided to glue the whole things together, even the parts that worked! This was incredibly annoying, since now instead of spending 30-40$ on parts, I needed to spend 60 to get a no-name replacement, or like 80 or 90 for a genuine Sony part! How frustrating, what were they thinking!?

I went with the no name replacement, and for 60$ after tax and shipping, I'm kinda disappointed. It works, but it is nowhere near as good as the actual Sony part, the leather on top already shows some damage, and the hinges feel very flimsy, but they do work. Repairing these headphones is much like working on a phone or smartwatch - no soldering to be done, but lots of complex boards and little screws. I'm very conflicted on whether or not I like the design. It's not durable, but repair wasn't too bad. I fitted a pair of Brainwavz earpads and now they're good to go!

I think these things are kinda meh sounding without an EQ. Pretty boomy without much detail. But the real meat of these is when you EQ them, they can become very balanced while still being some fun bass cannons. I like them in the car! Noise cancelling and the boosted bass fare well there. My beloved V6s lose all of the bass in the car for some reason.

I am planning to sell these too.",2024-04-03 05:09:56,After

headphones,Digital Trends: Sony WH-1000XM4 Review,"As a WH-1000XM2 user (but bought on clearance), the XM3's and XM4's are really such minor upgrades that it's a joke to call them a new product.

I'm not audiophile so my XM2's sound good enough for me, but **there are SO MANY QoL/features these (and other) headphones in this category are missing out on.**

USB-C should work as both data AND power AND at the same time. With 3.5mm obviously being there as a choice.

Offer some form of low latency wireless sound. Whether it's AptX Adaptive (AptX LL is EoL), or a WiFi based dongle (like gaming headsets offer). $300+ wireless headphones aren't solely for music, so latency matters!

Make the mics usable! No, no, I'm not talking about quality, I'm talking about the fact that like NONE of these traveler headphones let you use the mics when in an form of a wired mode.

Make the batteries accessible! They don't have to be easily accessible to hot swap or anything, but don't glue every part of the headphones including the battery in place. Because these devices have a battery they have a lifespan before they die, don't force owners to toss out a quality device simply because it's 5 years old.

Multi-point/connection BT that works, it's 2020, if my $30 Chinese wireless earbuds can do it, Sony can to.

I'm not sure if this still applies but my XM2's are designed in such a way that they don't work with most headphone cables, support what actually exists Sony, don't just hit the 3.5mm jack spec and not actually test it with other cables.

Software updates should never worsen a product. If you're going to make changes that compromise what already exists (ANC...) update the device but make it an option in the app, don't just pull an Apple or Bose and tell users to deal with it.

This is kinda a rant, but it's crazy how the premium BT ANC headphone market is growing, yet companies like Sony who were once at the forefront, simply don't improve their devices a noticable amount, despite there being plenty to improve upon that isnt solely sound quality.",2020-08-06 19:11:30,Before

headphones,Digital Trends: Sony WH-1000XM4 Review,"This feels like such an own-goal in favor Apple entering the market with even half-decent ANC cans.

I have the XM2s and have mostly been underwhelmed. The sound is ok, but the ear cups are so shallow the drivers rub my cartilage and make them sore after an hour.

The noise calibration doesn't pause the audio you're playing, so it takes 15-20s to activate and complete, then you realize you missed out on audio. How is Sony so bad at UX? They never use their own products?

The lack of multi-point BT is absurd. I use these to listen to: phone, laptop, Apple TV. And if I had a tablet, that's a 4th device. Let me cycle through these!

How can wind noise sound so familiar in tone and predictable in pattern but nobody can use clever ML/AI to filter this out? Or even road noise if you leave near a freeway or train noise. 

This is where I expect Apple to wipe the floor with other brands. Their HomePod already samples many times a second to know how to fire the tweeters based on proximity of objects, right? And I bet they can sample other nearby headphones—like many passengers on the same train car—for ambient noise to filter out.

I'm just so tired of YT hype beasting and every  brand thinking we just care about ANC, which honestly isn't that much better than NC switched off.",2020-08-10 08:37:21,Before
headphones,Am I doing something wrong with my Sony WH-1000XM4...?,"The WH-1000XM4 aren't tuned very well, they have way too much bass and recessed upper mids, which makes them sound muddy a muffled.

I would recommend using EQ, and by that I don't mean the EQ in the Sony app but parametric EQ. Download Equalizer APO with Peace UI on Windows, or Poweramp Equalizer on Android, apply the filters from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/db11bmvccxgyd97/Sony%20WH1000XM4.pdf) and then adjust further to your preference. You can get a much more balanced sound this way.

Also not being able to tell the difference between 320kbps and FLAC is normal, you would need to know what kind of compression artifacts to listen for and even then it's extremely difficult to tell apart a FLAC file from a well encoded 320kbps file. Personally I can't hear a difference.",2023-11-22 16:56:48,After

LDAC on highest settinga makes your music sound a little bit better assuming it isn't already very compressed or has enough complexity",2023-11-22 18:04:49,After
headphones,Am I doing something wrong with my Sony WH-1000XM4...?,"You aren't doing anything wrong. They aren't the best sounding headphones, especially if you don't use their own integrated EQ (which you are doing as soon as you turn them on). They basically have to do a bit of magic to make sure that both of the ear cups sound the same, because of the proximity sensor.

But basically they sound pretty good and have outstanding features. They are no high end headphone, but they are still enjoyable. You can certainly EQ them to your liking. On android I'd recommend Wavelet for that, on windows EqualizerAPO. You can find suggested EQ's online to get them to sound more closer to the Harman Target (something the average human find pleasing sounding). But you can also experiment with them a bit to figure out what you like :) 

The LDAC support won't really add anything. The differences are minute anyway. I'd assume the HD 598SE will sound better overall, at least if you have a half decent source :D",2023-11-22 22:21:35,After
