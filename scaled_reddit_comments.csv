SonyHeadphones,WF-1000XM4 - Severe Battery Issues,"**PLEASE READ THE LATEST UPDATES AT THE BOTTOM OF THE THREAD. UPDATED NOV 3rd 2023.**

---

Starting at the end of July, there have been a large number of reports of *severe* uneven battery drain in the WF-1000XM4 earbuds. The common factor appears to be the 1.4.2 update. The most concerning symptom that some users have been reporting (myself included) is that the affected earbud is now getting hotter than expected while charging in the case.

See my running list of reports here **(has not been updated since Sep 2nd, 2022 - there are now thousands of reports)**: https://pastebin.com/H20eF2x6 Each post has numerous additional reports in the comment section. If we're seeing this much activity, it's safe to assume that this is a *much* bigger problem than represented by this subset of users.

I tried to bring this to the attention of Sony, but their call center managers unsurprisingly couldn't care less about escalating what could be a *major* issue. They *will* replace them with a brand new pair under warranty, but I have yet to receive mine and test them.

I've reached out to a number of high-profile reviewers and they're tracking this issue separately and attempting to replicate it on their end.

---

EDIT 9/7/2022: Added additional reports.

---

EDIT 9/14/2022: Added lots of additional reports. New warranty-exhange earbuds arrived with firmware version 1.5.0 installed. I'll let everyone know if the issue persists.

---

EDIT 9/16/2022: My brand new pair that shipped with 1.5.0 doesn't appear to be having the same issue (yet). There's still a ~5% difference after a few hours of use, but that's probably due to the extra processing being performed in the right earbud. I'll update this after I try to drain the case/earbuds to 0%, charge, and test again.

Note: Several people have reported that the issue is *still* present on their warranty-replacement pair, so take my update with a grain of salt.

---

EDIT 9/28/2022: The new pair that shipped with 1.5.0 *still* hasn't experienced any issues with battery life or overheating. I'm curious if maybe these ones never had 1.4.2 on them, and some of the users who reported issues with their 1.5.0 pair had them upgraded from 1.4.2 in the factory.

---

EDIT 9/29/2022: Another thought - if we're all experiencing some form of overheating while charging since upgrading to 1.4.2 (whether we catch it happening or not) this could be causing permanent damage to the battery in the affected earbud. 

This might also explain why some users running 1.5.0 have reported the issue: if it was charged in-factory while running 1.4.2, overheated, and was upgraded to 1.5.0 prior to shipping, that could explain why the issue persists.

I'll be very curious to see if the issue persists with users who upgrade to 1.5.0 after it's publicly available.

---

EDIT 10/06/2022: Added at least a dozen brand new reports from Japan. My guess is that the 1.4.2 update just released there.

Sony Japan is apparently collecting a ""collection survey"" regarding the issue (translated from a Japanese tweet).

Here's the official report: https://i.imgur.com/WANV64y.jpg

**Here's our first battery expansion report -- in other words, this is REALLY bad for Sony: https://twitter.com/cardamon00/status/1577596298005741575**

---

EDIT 10/25/2022: Lots of US customers are reporting that Sony is no longer hassling them about out-of-warranty returns and is replacing the earbuds with no questions asked.

Thanks to everyone who has contributed to this thread! If anything changes, I'll update it.

Something else I've noticed is that the left and right earbuds now connect to my devices independently. In the past, the right earbud had to be active in order for either to connect. Can anyone else confirm this behavior?

---

EDIT 11/02/2022: It looks like this downgrade tool works with the XM4 buds: https://www.mrwalkman.com/p/mdrproxyfwsidegradetool.html?m=1

Use it at your own risk. Since the battery damage is likely permanent, this may not help.

If you're stuck with a 1.4.2 set and can't exchange it, using a charger with 500ma or less may prolong its life.

---

EDIT 11/16/2022: **One user reported that downgrading resolved the issues, and another user reported that Sony Support (EU) is claiming that a firmware update will be released this month to resolve the issue.**

This gives me some hope that the vast majority of the battery issues are not permanent and replacements won't be necessary going forward. For the time being, I'd continue with the replacement process. The worst-case scenario is that you have to wait a few weeks, but end up with a brand-new pair that should have a longer lifespan.

**NOTE 03/01/2023: This has proven to be untrue. For the vast majority of users, it appears that the damage done to the battery under firmware version 1.4.2 is permanent. Earlier/later firmware versions don't *cause* the battery issues, but they don't appear to fix them either.**

---

EDIT 01/24/2023: **Sony USA appears to have established a common process for addressing these RMAs with the following list of questions:**

1. Have you tried the reset process?
2. Is the unit getting hot while charging?
3. Is the red light blinking on the unit?

Replacements are being honored outside of the standard warranty period. Additionally, some users report that they were able to get replacements without their original proof of purchase.

---

EDIT 02/23/2023: One user reports that connecting to a VPN node in Japan allowed them to update to 1.6.1. The prompt appeared automatically shortly after connecting and opening the app.

**As predicted in my 10/06/2022 edit, we finally have our first report of an ""exploding"" earbud.

---

**EDIT 02/27/2023: Firmware version 2.0.0 has been released globally with multipoint support and a roll-up of the previous battery fixes in 1.5.0 and 1.6.1.**

https://www.sony.com/electronics/support/wireless-headphones-bluetooth-headphones/wh-1000xm4/software/00289102

I updated my headset (from 1.5.0), so I'll update this thread with the results after I've used it for a week or so.

My initial impression is that the bluetooth multipoint works very well out of the box! What a relief to finally have this feature.

---

**EDIT 03/01/2023: Battery life appears to be shorter on 2.0.0 than 1.5.0 with my set that was never affected by the battery issues, however I am using multipoint. Other reviewers have reported that 1.6.1 slightly reduced battery life in an effort to limit strain on the battery.**

Some users who were affected by the battery issues and updated to 2.0.0 report longer battery life than 1.4.2, but not significantly so. Other users are reporting shorter battery life.

One user reports that 2.0.0 caused the battery drain issue to affect the opposite earbud(!?) We'll need further confirmation of this behavior.

Once again, I think it's important to emphasize that the damage to the batteries is probably already beyond the point of repair, and an RMA is your best option if you're still on 1.4.2.

--- 

**EDIT 03/01/2023 (2): Both myself and at least two are users are reporting that the battery life reported by the app changes significantly after placing the earbuds back into the case and removing them.** In one reported case, the reported battery life jumped from 1% -> 81%. In my case, with a set unaffected by the 1.4.2 battery issues, the right earbud went from 26% to 14% and left earbud from 47% to 31% after placing and removing them from the case. **This has been an issue off and on in multiple firmware versions, but it's concerning to see it return in 2.0.0.**

Despite the dramatic change in battery percentage, mine are still within a reasonable range of each other after ~6 hours of listening.

It's too early to say if this is a bigger issue, or if it will lead to the same battery issues as 1.4.2 did, but I'll make sure to keep this updated.

**I should also note, I haven't experienced any high temps while charging on 2.0.0.**

---

**EDIT 03/07/2023: While I'm still not experiencing any major issues on 2.0.0, *many* users are reporting that their battery life is FAR worse on 2.0.0 than 1.4.2.**

These are the issues I've noticed so far on 2.0.0 with my earbuds that were *unaffected* by the 1.4.2 battery life issues:

- Slightly reduced battery life versus 1.5.0
- Miscalculation of battery percentage until replaced/removed from case (present in older versions as well)
- Occasional bluetooth multipoint roaming issues that are likely caused by the audio source rather than the earbud firmware

---

**EDIT 03/23/2023: From the *many* new comments since the 2.0.0 update, the general consensus seems to be the following:**

- The 2.0.0 update doesn't introduce any *new* battery issues, however the multipoint feature will drain your battery faster if enabled.
- The 1.4.2 -> 2.0.0 upgrade path doesn't *fix* any of the battery issues on sets affected by them, and will make them substantially worse in most cases.
- RMAing your earbuds is the only *supported* option at this point. Downgrading will not fix your issues, but may result in a marginal improvement to battery life, and may prevent additional damage to the batteries. Replacing your batteries at home *will* fixed the issues in all *reported* instances, but runs a risk of failure/destruction of your headset, and voids any warranty.

**To answer the most commonly-asked questions:**

- Yes, it's safe to update from 1.5.0 or 1.6.2 to 2.0.0, but it's probably unnecessary unless you want to take advantage of the multipoint functionality.
- No, it is not safe to update from 1.4.2 to 2.0.0. Don't do it.
- Unless you're unable to, RMAing your earbuds is absolutely **the best option.**

One more note -- a user just reported that you are able to use the earbuds independently of each other if you disable the Google Assistant functionality! Pretty cool. It will also be interesting to see if this reduces the *normal* uneven battery drain effect.

---

**EDIT 03/31/2023: The uneven drain (~15% after 6+ hours of usage) on 2.0.0 with multipoint enabled was completely resolved when I disabled Google Assistant.**

I have been having some frustrating multipoint roaming issues where one of my Windows 11 PCs will occasionally no longer transmit sound unless I connect/disconnect multiple times in a certain order. This happens after another Windows 11 PC is connected.

---

EDIT 04/14/2023: Recently, I began having real difficulty getting sound output when switching between devices when using multi-point. My phone's output worked 100% of the time, but multiple computers I connect to required me to disconnect and reconnect through the app (not from bluetooth settings), or put the buds back in the case, then take them out and reconnect. It's almost as if they're recognized as two devices under the same ID.

Why am I adding this seemingly-irrelevant issue to the thread? Because even wiping my settings, turning off multi-point, and doing a factory reset didn't fix the issue, so I decided to downgrade to 1.6.1.

**I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS. The 2.0.0 -> 1.6.1 downgrade path breaks the touch-sensitive buttons, causing a voice output of ""device 2 replaced"" every time they're pressed.**

Upgrading to 2.0.0 again resolved that issue, but I have yet to confirm if my sound output and bluetooth roaming issues are resolved as well.

---

EDIT 04/20/2023: A user reported that you can resolve the touch-button issue on the 2.0.0 -> 1.6.1 downgrade path by reinstalling the English language package.

Another user reported that changing the language in the headphones app under Notification & Voice Guide to another language and then back to English fixed it.

---

EDIT 04/25/2023: Another battery expansion report by a fellow Redditor: https://www.reddit.com/r/SonyHeadphones/comments/12yuf7o/my_wf_xm4s_finally_bit_it/

---

EDIT 05/01/2023: One user reported that a Sony rep. let it slip that both the batteries in the original run *and* the 1.4.2 software update are to blame for the issues.

---

**EDIT 07/31/2023:** Here's an **iFixIt guide on how to replace the batteries** yourself: https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Sony+WF-1000XM4+Wireless+Earbuds+battery+replacement/162365

Furthermore, another user has provided some interesting speculation as to what the root cause might be in the comment section of this Verge post:
https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/25/23806918/sony-wf-1000xm5-earbuds-battery-drain-statement?commentID=ecfcbde9-5843-4b61-8c87-21f3c6c0e9a6


Essentially, Sony *may* have had a supply issue with the new model of batteries they wanted to use in the XM4 and ended up using the same batteries as the XM3. When the supply issues eased and they transitioned to the new batteries, a firmware update optimized for the increased voltage of the new batteries permanently damaged the earbuds using the older, lower-voltage batteries. This is a pretty convincing argument considering other pieces of information we've been drip-fed over the past year.
[ORIGINAL COMMENT - IMAGE HERE](https://i.imgur.com/ASPZwiL.png)

**UPDATE 9/14/2023: This theory has been pretty thoroughly refuted by new evidence.**

---

**EDIT 09/06/2023:** For those still interested in an RCA for the issue, one Reddit user reports that the explanation in the previous edit doesn't align with their experience. In their case, the battery issue was occurring despite their unit having the newer model of batteries: 

> Just replaced battery manually following youtube guides. I don't think the old model of battery is the problem because in my case the old battery which was causing the problem is the same model (Z55H) as the new one.

In another thread a Reddit user reported that Sony exchanged an RMA'd pair of XM4s for a new set of XM5s. Nice!

---

**EDIT 10/30/2023:** In the USA there's currently a 3-month backorder on WF-1000XM4 replacement sets. Sony is currently offering refunds to (presumably) *all* customers with a valid receipt.

---

**EDIT 11/03/2023:** I originally removed this from the post because I believed it to be speculation, but I've seen quite a few reports that there are similar battery issues affecting the WF-1000XM5s. In fact, one user reports that they've gone through multiple RMAs *and* that they have friends who've encountered the same issues on their XM5s.

To add to the frustration, it seems that the offer that Sony USA is giving XM4 RMA requesters (refunds or upgrades to the XM5) isn't being honored worldwide. A few users have even said that Sony isn't acknowledging *any* issues in certain countries.

--- 

**EDIT 02/14/2024:** One user reports that United Repairs has the parts for the XM4s back in stock, so they're repairing rather than replacing them.

**I've also seen additional reports of exploding earbuds over the past few months. I'd really recommend stopping use immediately.**",2022-09-06 21:49:30,"Update on my end:

My original rants was posted here if anyone interested:

In the end, SONY UK DID NOT stand up to their own mistake & faulty products. The customer service straight up rejected my faulty buds and suggested that I need to pay for the repair.

I decided not to waste time with them. I ordered some batteries and replaced them by myself. Total cost about £10. I used a hairdryer and some pins to pry it open. It was an ugly job, but everything works with new batteries. (still old firmware)

**To answer the most commonly-asked questions:**

- Yes, it's safe to update from 1.5.0 or 1.6.2 to 2.0.0, but it's probably unnecessary unless you want to take advantage of the multipoint functionality.
- No, it is not safe to update from 1.4.2 to 2.0.0. Don't do it.
- Unless you're unable to, RMAing your earbuds is absolutely **the best option.**

One more note -- a user just reported that you are able to use the earbuds independently of each other if you disable the Google Assistant functionality! Pretty cool. It will also be interesting to see if this reduces the *normal* uneven battery drain effect.

---

**EDIT 03/31/2023: The uneven drain (~15% after 6+ hours of usage) on 2.0.0 with multipoint enabled was completely resolved when I disabled Google Assistant.**

I have been having some frustrating multipoint roaming issues where one of my Windows 11 PCs will occasionally no longer transmit sound unless I connect/disconnect multiple times in a certain order. This happens after another Windows 11 PC is connected.

---

EDIT 04/14/2023: Recently, I began having real difficulty getting sound output when switching between devices when using multi-point. My phone's output worked 100% of the time, but multiple computers I connect to required me to disconnect and reconnect through the app (not from bluetooth settings), or put the buds back in the case, then take them out and reconnect. It's almost as if they're recognized as two devices under the same ID.

Why am I adding this seemingly-irrelevant issue to the thread? Because even wiping my settings, turning off multi-point, and doing a factory reset didn't fix the issue, so I decided to downgrade to 1.6.1.

**I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS. The 2.0.0 -> 1.6.1 downgrade path breaks the touch-sensitive buttons, causing a voice output of ""device 2 replaced"" every time they're pressed.**

Upgrading to 2.0.0 again resolved that issue, but I have yet to confirm if my sound output and bluetooth roaming issues are resolved as well.

---

EDIT 04/20/2023: A user reported that you can resolve the touch-button issue on the 2.0.0 -> 1.6.1 downgrade path by reinstalling the English language package.

Another user reported that changing the language in the headphones app under Notification & Voice Guide to another language and then back to English fixed it.

Essentially, Sony *may* have had a supply issue with the new model of batteries they wanted to use in the XM4 and ended up using the same batteries as the XM3. When the supply issues eased and they transitioned to the new batteries, a firmware update optimized for the increased voltage of the new batteries permanently damaged the earbuds using the older, lower-voltage batteries. This is a pretty convincing argument considering other pieces of information we've been drip-fed over the past year.

**EDIT 09/06/2023:** For those still interested in an RCA for the issue, one Reddit user reports that the explanation in the previous edit doesn't align with their experience. In their case, the battery issue was occurring despite their unit having the newer model of batteries: 

> Just replaced battery manually following youtube guides. I don't think the old model of battery is the problem because in my case the old battery which was causing the problem is the same model (Z55H) as the new one.

In another thread a Reddit user reported that Sony exchanged an RMA'd pair of XM4s for a new set of XM5s. Nice!

**EDIT 11/03/2023:** I originally removed this from the post because I believed it to be speculation, but I've seen quite a few reports that there are similar battery issues affecting the WF-1000XM5s. In fact, one user reports that they've gone through multiple RMAs *and* that they have friends who've encountered the same issues on their XM5s.

To add to the frustration, it seems that the offer that Sony USA is giving XM4 RMA requesters (refunds or upgrades to the XM5) isn't being honored worldwide. A few users have even said that Sony isn't acknowledging *any* issues in certain countries.

**EDIT 02/14/2024:** One user reports that United Repairs has the parts for the XM4s back in stock, so they're repairing rather than replacing them.

**I've also seen additional reports of exploding earbuds over the past few months. I'd really recommend stopping use immediately.**",2022-09-06 21:49:30,"OP,  thank you for this thread.  I happened upon it while researching battery replacement for these buds, and I realized my battery drain might actually be ""a thing.""  I'm posting some details about what I went through with my contacts with support with the hopes it helps others.  My contact was only two days ago.

Disclaimer:  I'm new to Reddit, so if I've placed this wrongly, I'll apologize in advance.  Moreso, I tend to be long-winded, so I apologize for the length.

I started to experience battery problems, most noticeably a couple of weeks ago.  I am a casual user, not everyday, and I typically don't listen to music or use the buds for long periods.  But, a few months ago, I noticed that my left bud, when inserted, was not fully charged while the right one was.  I initially attributed this to quirkiness or (maybe) not allowing the buds to fully charge.  I was on a PC, so I never looked at the app to see what was going on.

Fast forward to a couple of weeks ago.  I was watching vids on the computer and was surprised by low battery warning.  Since I was on a PC, I still didn't look at the app to see the levels of the batteries on the buds.  I just threw them back into the case.  But, I noted it seemed like the buds weren't lasting like they used to.

This happened multiple times over the last few weeks, so I started to research battery replacement for these buds, and I came upon this thread.  This caused me to take a completely different approach to what was going on with my earbuds.

A few things to note in comparison to what I found in this thread:

1. I was not seeing any signs of ""significant"" over-heating.  They were never hot in my ear and any temp change was not noticeable.  My case never flashed a red light, but the left bud charged at a 20 degree (F) higher temp than the right one did.
2. I was not experiencing the tremendously short running life (less than one hour) that others had expressed in this thread.
3. I did notice a significant drain with the left bud when compared to the right bud, but I hadn't actually timed how long the buds would go before being drained.

So after experiencing what I had, and seeing the information in this thread, I contacted Support via chat from this page:  [https://www.sony.com/electronics/support/wireless-headphones-bluetooth-headphones](https://www.sony.com/electronics/support/wireless-headphones-bluetooth-headphones)   When you get to this page look for the question mark icon on the right (I am on a PC). That is for chat. When you select that, you will see an option for ""Get support from a live agent."" That's what I chose to start the process.

The first agent I had contact with asked some basic questions and then asked me to describe my problem.  He confirmed my location and purchase date, and he then asked me to detail my issue.  In addition to what I mentioned above, I also related that the left bud would often not fully charge (90-95%) while the right was at 100%.  He confirmed if I had done a reset and initialization (I had) and then asked if I did a timed test with certain settings (I had not)..  Since I had not done a timed test (to see if the buds would last three hours) he asked me to do so and report back after-the-fact.

I did the timed test with all of the prescribed settings, and my left bud died (0%) at the three hour mark.  At that point my right bud was at 54%.

With that information, I recontacted  support through the chat and reported my results.  The tech, after receiving the results, initially said it appeared that my buds needed service, but he then initiated the process for replacing my (out of warranty) buds with a new set.  I didn't have to ask for second level review.  Shortly after my second contact with support, I received an email with instructions and a mailing label for returning my pair.

So, I am now in the process for having these buds replaced.  Language in the agreement tends to show that my current buds may be subject to inspection to determine if I damaged them in any way, but it's looking like Sony is going to replace them.

Dealing with support was rather painless with all things considered, and it appears that I'll end up with a replacement set.

For those keeping track, I am in the US, and I was out of warranty almost eight months, as the buds were purchased on Amazon in July, 2021.",2023-02-20 06:18:32,Before
SonyHeadphones,WF-1000XM4 - Severe Battery Issues,"**PLEASE READ THE LATEST UPDATES AT THE BOTTOM OF THE THREAD. UPDATED NOV 3rd 2023.**

---

Starting at the end of July, there have been a large number of reports of *severe* uneven battery drain in the WF-1000XM4 earbuds. The common factor appears to be the 1.4.2 update. The most concerning symptom that some users have been reporting (myself included) is that the affected earbud is now getting hotter than expected while charging in the case.

See my running list of reports here **(has not been updated since Sep 2nd, 2022 - there are now thousands of reports)**: https://pastebin.com/H20eF2x6 Each post has numerous additional reports in the comment section. If we're seeing this much activity, it's safe to assume that this is a *much* bigger problem than represented by this subset of users.

I tried to bring this to the attention of Sony, but their call center managers unsurprisingly couldn't care less about escalating what could be a *major* issue. They *will* replace them with a brand new pair under warranty, but I have yet to receive mine and test them.

I've reached out to a number of high-profile reviewers and they're tracking this issue separately and attempting to replicate it on their end.

---

EDIT 9/7/2022: Added additional reports.

---

EDIT 9/14/2022: Added lots of additional reports. New warranty-exhange earbuds arrived with firmware version 1.5.0 installed. I'll let everyone know if the issue persists.

---

EDIT 9/16/2022: My brand new pair that shipped with 1.5.0 doesn't appear to be having the same issue (yet). There's still a ~5% difference after a few hours of use, but that's probably due to the extra processing being performed in the right earbud. I'll update this after I try to drain the case/earbuds to 0%, charge, and test again.

Note: Several people have reported that the issue is *still* present on their warranty-replacement pair, so take my update with a grain of salt.

---

EDIT 9/28/2022: The new pair that shipped with 1.5.0 *still* hasn't experienced any issues with battery life or overheating. I'm curious if maybe these ones never had 1.4.2 on them, and some of the users who reported issues with their 1.5.0 pair had them upgraded from 1.4.2 in the factory.

---

EDIT 9/29/2022: Another thought - if we're all experiencing some form of overheating while charging since upgrading to 1.4.2 (whether we catch it happening or not) this could be causing permanent damage to the battery in the affected earbud. 

This might also explain why some users running 1.5.0 have reported the issue: if it was charged in-factory while running 1.4.2, overheated, and was upgraded to 1.5.0 prior to shipping, that could explain why the issue persists.

I'll be very curious to see if the issue persists with users who upgrade to 1.5.0 after it's publicly available.

---

EDIT 10/06/2022: Added at least a dozen brand new reports from Japan. My guess is that the 1.4.2 update just released there.

Sony Japan is apparently collecting a ""collection survey"" regarding the issue (translated from a Japanese tweet).

Here's the official report: https://i.imgur.com/WANV64y.jpg

**Here's our first battery expansion report -- in other words, this is REALLY bad for Sony: https://twitter.com/cardamon00/status/1577596298005741575**

---

EDIT 10/25/2022: Lots of US customers are reporting that Sony is no longer hassling them about out-of-warranty returns and is replacing the earbuds with no questions asked.

Thanks to everyone who has contributed to this thread! If anything changes, I'll update it.

Something else I've noticed is that the left and right earbuds now connect to my devices independently. In the past, the right earbud had to be active in order for either to connect. Can anyone else confirm this behavior?

---

EDIT 11/02/2022: It looks like this downgrade tool works with the XM4 buds: https://www.mrwalkman.com/p/mdrproxyfwsidegradetool.html?m=1

Use it at your own risk. Since the battery damage is likely permanent, this may not help.

If you're stuck with a 1.4.2 set and can't exchange it, using a charger with 500ma or less may prolong its life.

---

EDIT 11/16/2022: **One user reported that downgrading resolved the issues, and another user reported that Sony Support (EU) is claiming that a firmware update will be released this month to resolve the issue.**

This gives me some hope that the vast majority of the battery issues are not permanent and replacements won't be necessary going forward. For the time being, I'd continue with the replacement process. The worst-case scenario is that you have to wait a few weeks, but end up with a brand-new pair that should have a longer lifespan.

**NOTE 03/01/2023: This has proven to be untrue. For the vast majority of users, it appears that the damage done to the battery under firmware version 1.4.2 is permanent. Earlier/later firmware versions don't *cause* the battery issues, but they don't appear to fix them either.**

---

EDIT 01/24/2023: **Sony USA appears to have established a common process for addressing these RMAs with the following list of questions:**

1. Have you tried the reset process?
2. Is the unit getting hot while charging?
3. Is the red light blinking on the unit?

Replacements are being honored outside of the standard warranty period. Additionally, some users report that they were able to get replacements without their original proof of purchase.

---

EDIT 02/23/2023: One user reports that connecting to a VPN node in Japan allowed them to update to 1.6.1. The prompt appeared automatically shortly after connecting and opening the app.

**As predicted in my 10/06/2022 edit, we finally have our first report of an ""exploding"" earbud. To be honest, my guess is that battery expansion progressively weakened the epoxy seal, and it finally popped apart explosively (since there's no sign of puncture or charring of the battery/case), but it's still a really bad look for Sony, especially since multiple tech media outlets are reporting on it.**

https://www.reddit.com/r/SonyHeadphones/comments/117ueiy/wf1000xm4_battery_exploded_while_in_charging_case/

---

**EDIT 02/27/2023: Firmware version 2.0.0 has been released globally with multipoint support and a roll-up of the previous battery fixes in 1.5.0 and 1.6.1.**

https://www.sony.com/electronics/support/wireless-headphones-bluetooth-headphones/wh-1000xm4/software/00289102

I updated my headset (from 1.5.0), so I'll update this thread with the results after I've used it for a week or so.

My initial impression is that the bluetooth multipoint works very well out of the box! What a relief to finally have this feature.

---

**EDIT 03/01/2023: Battery life appears to be shorter on 2.0.0 than 1.5.0 with my set that was never affected by the battery issues, however I am using multipoint. Other reviewers have reported that 1.6.1 slightly reduced battery life in an effort to limit strain on the battery.**

Some users who were affected by the battery issues and updated to 2.0.0 report longer battery life than 1.4.2, but not significantly so. Other users are reporting shorter battery life.

One user reports that 2.0.0 caused the battery drain issue to affect the opposite earbud(!?) We'll need further confirmation of this behavior.

Once again, I think it's important to emphasize that the damage to the batteries is probably already beyond the point of repair, and an RMA is your best option if you're still on 1.4.2.

--- 

**EDIT 03/01/2023 (2): Both myself and at least two are users are reporting that the battery life reported by the app changes significantly after placing the earbuds back into the case and removing them.** In one reported case, the reported battery life jumped from 1% -> 81%. In my case, with a set unaffected by the 1.4.2 battery issues, the right earbud went from 26% to 14% and left earbud from 47% to 31% after placing and removing them from the case. **This has been an issue off and on in multiple firmware versions, but it's concerning to see it return in 2.0.0.**

Despite the dramatic change in battery percentage, mine are still within a reasonable range of each other after ~6 hours of listening.

It's too early to say if this is a bigger issue, or if it will lead to the same battery issues as 1.4.2 did, but I'll make sure to keep this updated.

**I should also note, I haven't experienced any high temps while charging on 2.0.0.**

---

**EDIT 03/07/2023: While I'm still not experiencing any major issues on 2.0.0, *many* users are reporting that their battery life is FAR worse on 2.0.0 than 1.4.2.**

These are the issues I've noticed so far on 2.0.0 with my earbuds that were *unaffected* by the 1.4.2 battery life issues:

- Slightly reduced battery life versus 1.5.0
- Miscalculation of battery percentage until replaced/removed from case (present in older versions as well)
- Occasional bluetooth multipoint roaming issues that are likely caused by the audio source rather than the earbud firmware

---

**EDIT 03/23/2023: From the *many* new comments since the 2.0.0 update, the general consensus seems to be the following:**

- The 2.0.0 update doesn't introduce any *new* battery issues, however the multipoint feature will drain your battery faster if enabled.
- The 1.4.2 -> 2.0.0 upgrade path doesn't *fix* any of the battery issues on sets affected by them, and will make them substantially worse in most cases.
- RMAing your earbuds is the only *supported* option at this point. Downgrading will not fix your issues, but may result in a marginal improvement to battery life, and may prevent additional damage to the batteries. Replacing your batteries at home *will* fixed the issues in all *reported* instances, but runs a risk of failure/destruction of your headset, and voids any warranty.

**To answer the most commonly-asked questions:**

- Yes, it's safe to update from 1.5.0 or 1.6.2 to 2.0.0, but it's probably unnecessary unless you want to take advantage of the multipoint functionality.

I put them to charge in the case (it was 100% at the time) and left it there for a couple of hours, when I got them back they were really hot, both buds had only around 80% battery and the case had only 17%, which is REALLY weird, since the case should have more than one charge.  


I kept using them and noticed that battery life was getting worse and worse. At one point I saw the case blinking red, which is the overheating warning, right?  


So I read this thread and saw about the RMA, which is not an option for me, I bought these buds in the USA and I live in Brazil, which doesn't have this product released (only the WH XM4 exists here), so I won't be able to do anything with them here.  


So I decided to stop using them and moved to the AirPods Pro 2nd gen, and will leave the XM4 stored here, hopefully a future firmware can solve this, if my battery isn't already fucked",2023-03-02 18:10:26,Before

**Here's our first battery expansion report -- in other words, this is REALLY bad for Sony: https://twitter.com/cardamon00/status/1577596298005741575**

---

EDIT 10/25/2022: Lots of US customers are reporting that Sony is no longer hassling them about out-of-warranty returns and is replacing the earbuds with no questions asked.

Thanks to everyone who has contributed to this thread! If anything changes, I'll update it.

Something else I've noticed is that the left and right earbuds now connect to my devices independently. In the past, the right earbud had to be active in order for either to connect. Can anyone else confirm this behavior?

---

EDIT 11/02/2022: It looks like this downgrade tool works with the XM4 buds: https://www.mrwalkman.com/p/mdrproxyfwsidegradetool.html?m=1

Use it at your own risk. Since the battery damage is likely permanent, this may not help.

If you're stuck with a 1.4.2 set and can't exchange it, using a charger with 500ma or less may prolong its life.

---

EDIT 11/16/2022: **One user reported that downgrading resolved the issues, and another user reported that Sony Support (EU) is claiming that a firmware update will be released this month to resolve the issue.**

This gives me some hope that the vast majority of the battery issues are not permanent and replacements won't be necessary going forward. For the time being, I'd continue with the replacement process. The worst-case scenario is that you have to wait a few weeks, but end up with a brand-new pair that should have a longer lifespan.

**NOTE 03/01/2023: This has proven to be untrue. For the vast majority of users, it appears that the damage done to the battery under firmware version 1.4.2 is permanent. Earlier/later firmware versions don't *cause* the battery issues, but they don't appear to fix them either.**

---

EDIT 01/24/2023: **Sony USA appears to have established a common process for addressing these RMAs with the following list of questions:**

1. Have you tried the reset process?
2. Is the unit getting hot while charging?
3. Is the red light blinking on the unit?

Replacements are being honored outside of the standard warranty period. Additionally, some users report that they were able to get replacements without their original proof of purchase.

---

EDIT 02/23/2023: One user reports that connecting to a VPN node in Japan allowed them to update to 1.6.1. The prompt appeared automatically shortly after connecting and opening the app.

**As predicted in my 10/06/2022 edit, we finally have our first report of an ""exploding"" earbud. To be honest, my guess is that battery expansion progressively weakened the epoxy seal, and it finally popped apart explosively (since there's no sign of puncture or charring of the battery/case), but it's still a really bad look for Sony, especially since multiple tech media outlets are reporting on it.**

---

**EDIT 02/27/2023: Firmware version 2.0.0 has been released globally with multipoint support and a roll-up of the previous battery fixes in 1.5.0 and 1.6.1.**

https://www.sony.com/electronics/support/wireless-headphones-bluetooth-headphones/wh-1000xm4/software/00289102

I updated my headset (from 1.5.0), so I'll update this thread with the results after I've used it for a week or so.

My initial impression is that the bluetooth multipoint works very well out of the box! What a relief to finally have this feature.

---

**EDIT 03/01/2023: Battery life appears to be shorter on 2.0.0 than 1.5.0 with my set that was never affected by the battery issues, however I am using multipoint. Other reviewers have reported that 1.6.1 slightly reduced battery life in an effort to limit strain on the battery.**

Some users who were affected by the battery issues and updated to 2.0.0 report longer battery life than 1.4.2, but not significantly so. Other users are reporting shorter battery life.

One user reports that 2.0.0 caused the battery drain issue to affect the opposite earbud(!?) We'll need further confirmation of this behavior.

Once again, I think it's important to emphasize that the damage to the batteries is probably already beyond the point of repair, and an RMA is your best option if you're still on 1.4.2.

--- 

**EDIT 03/01/2023 (2): Both myself and at least two are users are reporting that the battery life reported by the app changes significantly after placing the earbuds back into the case and removing them.** In one reported case, the reported battery life jumped from 1% -> 81%. In my case, with a set unaffected by the 1.4.2 battery issues, the right earbud went from 26% to 14% and left earbud from 47% to 31% after placing and removing them from the case. **This has been an issue off and on in multiple firmware versions, but it's concerning to see it return in 2.0.0.**

Despite the dramatic change in battery percentage, mine are still within a reasonable range of each other after ~6 hours of listening.

It's too early to say if this is a bigger issue, or if it will lead to the same battery issues as 1.4.2 did, but I'll make sure to keep this updated.

**I should also note, I haven't experienced any high temps while charging on 2.0.0.**

---

**EDIT 03/07/2023: While I'm still not experiencing any major issues on 2.0.0, *many* users are reporting that their battery life is FAR worse on 2.0.0 than 1.4.2.**

These are the issues I've noticed so far on 2.0.0 with my earbuds that were *unaffected* by the 1.4.2 battery life issues:

- Slightly reduced battery life versus 1.5.0
- Miscalculation of battery percentage until replaced/removed from case (present in older versions as well)
- Occasional bluetooth multipoint roaming issues that are likely caused by the audio source rather than the earbud firmware

---

**EDIT 03/23/2023: From the *many* new comments since the 2.0.0 update, the general consensus seems to be the following:**

- The 2.0.0 update doesn't introduce any *new* battery issues, however the multipoint feature will drain your battery faster if enabled.
- The 1.4.2 -> 2.0.0 upgrade path doesn't *fix* any of the battery issues on sets affected by them, and will make them substantially worse in most cases.
- RMAing your earbuds is the only *supported* option at this point. Downgrading will not fix your issues, but may result in a marginal improvement to battery life, and may prevent additional damage to the batteries. Replacing your batteries at home *will* fixed the issues in all *reported* instances, but runs a risk of failure/destruction of your headset, and voids any warranty.

**To answer the most commonly-asked questions:**

- Yes, it's safe to update from 1.5.0 or 1.6.2 to 2.0.0, but it's probably unnecessary unless you want to take advantage of the multipoint functionality.
- No, it is not safe to update from 1.4.2 to 2.0.0. Don't do it.
- Unless you're unable to, RMAing your earbuds is absolutely **the best option.**

One more note -- a user just reported that you are able to use the earbuds independently of each other if you disable the Google Assistant functionality! Pretty cool. It will also be interesting to see if this reduces the *normal* uneven battery drain effect.

---

**EDIT 03/31/2023: The uneven drain (~15% after 6+ hours of usage) on 2.0.0 with multipoint enabled was completely resolved when I disabled Google Assistant.**

I have been having some frustrating multipoint roaming issues where one of my Windows 11 PCs will occasionally no longer transmit sound unless I connect/disconnect multiple times in a certain order. This happens after another Windows 11 PC is connected.

---

EDIT 04/14/2023: Recently, I began having real difficulty getting sound output when switching between devices when using multi-point. My phone's output worked 100% of the time, but multiple computers I connect to required me to disconnect and reconnect through the app (not from bluetooth settings), or put the buds back in the case, then take them out and reconnect. It's almost as if they're recognized as two devices under the same ID.

Why am I adding this seemingly-irrelevant issue to the thread? Because even wiping my settings, turning off multi-point, and doing a factory reset didn't fix the issue, so I decided to downgrade to 1.6.1.

**I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS. The 2.0.0 -> 1.6.1 downgrade path breaks the touch-sensitive buttons, causing a voice output of ""device 2 replaced"" every time they're pressed.**

Upgrading to 2.0.0 again resolved that issue, but I have yet to confirm if my sound output and bluetooth roaming issues are resolved as well.

---

EDIT 04/20/2023: A user reported that you can resolve the touch-button issue on the 2.0.0 -> 1.6.1 downgrade path by reinstalling the English language package.

Another user reported that changing the language in the headphones app under Notification & Voice Guide to another language and then back to English fixed it.

Essentially, Sony *may* have had a supply issue with the new model of batteries they wanted to use in the XM4 and ended up using the same batteries as the XM3. When the supply issues eased and they transitioned to the new batteries, a firmware update optimized for the increased voltage of the new batteries permanently damaged the earbuds using the older, lower-voltage batteries. This is a pretty convincing argument considering other pieces of information we've been drip-fed over the past year.

---

Starting at the end of July, there have been a large number of reports of *severe* uneven battery drain in the WF-1000XM4 earbuds. The common factor appears to be the 1.4.2 update. The most concerning symptom that some users have been reporting (myself included) is that the affected earbud is now getting hotter than expected while charging in the case.

See my running list of reports here **(has not been updated since Sep 2nd, 2022 - there are now thousands of reports)**: https://pastebin.com/H20eF2x6 Each post has numerous additional reports in the comment section. If we're seeing this much activity, it's safe to assume that this is a *much* bigger problem than represented by this subset of users.

I tried to bring this to the attention of Sony, but their call center managers unsurprisingly couldn't care less about escalating what could be a *major* issue. They *will* replace them with a brand new pair under warranty, but I have yet to receive mine and test them.

I've reached out to a number of high-profile reviewers and they're tracking this issue separately and attempting to replicate it on their end.

---

EDIT 9/7/2022: Added additional reports.

---

EDIT 9/14/2022: Added lots of additional reports. New warranty-exhange earbuds arrived with firmware version 1.5.0 installed. I'll let everyone know if the issue persists.

---

EDIT 9/16/2022: My brand new pair that shipped with 1.5.0 doesn't appear to be having the same issue (yet). There's still a ~5% difference after a few hours of use, but that's probably due to the extra processing being performed in the right earbud. I'll update this after I try to drain the case/earbuds to 0%, charge, and test again.

Note: Several people have reported that the issue is *still* present on their warranty-replacement pair, so take my update with a grain of salt.

---

EDIT 9/28/2022: The new pair that shipped with 1.5.0 *still* hasn't experienced any issues with battery life or overheating. I'm curious if maybe these ones never had 1.4.2 on them, and some of the users who reported issues with their 1.5.0 pair had them upgraded from 1.4.2 in the factory.

---

EDIT 9/29/2022: Another thought - if we're all experiencing some form of overheating while charging since upgrading to 1.4.2 (whether we catch it happening or not) this could be causing permanent damage to the battery in the affected earbud. 

This might also explain why some users running 1.5.0 have reported the issue: if it was charged in-factory while running 1.4.2, overheated, and was upgraded to 1.5.0 prior to shipping, that could explain why the issue persists.

I'll be very curious to see if the issue persists with users who upgrade to 1.5.0 after it's publicly available.

---

EDIT 10/06/2022: Added at least a dozen brand new reports from Japan. My guess is that the 1.4.2 update just released there.

Sony Japan is apparently collecting a ""collection survey"" regarding the issue (translated from a Japanese tweet).

EDIT 9/14/2022: Added lots of additional reports. New warranty-exhange earbuds arrived with firmware version 1.5.0 installed. I'll let everyone know if the issue persists.

---

EDIT 9/16/2022: My brand new pair that shipped with 1.5.0 doesn't appear to be having the same issue (yet). There's still a ~5% difference after a few hours of use, but that's probably due to the extra processing being performed in the right earbud. I'll update this after I try to drain the case/earbuds to 0%, charge, and test again.

Note: Several people have reported that the issue is *still* present on their warranty-replacement pair, so take my update with a grain of salt.

---

EDIT 9/28/2022: The new pair that shipped with 1.5.0 *still* hasn't experienced any issues with battery life or overheating. I'm curious if maybe these ones never had 1.4.2 on them, and some of the users who reported issues with their 1.5.0 pair had them upgraded from 1.4.2 in the factory.

---

EDIT 9/29/2022: Another thought - if we're all experiencing some form of overheating while charging since upgrading to 1.4.2 (whether we catch it happening or not) this could be causing permanent damage to the battery in the affected earbud. 

This might also explain why some users running 1.5.0 have reported the issue: if it was charged in-factory while running 1.4.2, overheated, and was upgraded to 1.5.0 prior to shipping, that could explain why the issue persists.

I'll be very curious to see if the issue persists with users who upgrade to 1.5.0 after it's publicly available.

---

EDIT 10/06/2022: Added at least a dozen brand new reports from Japan. My guess is that the 1.4.2 update just released there.

Sony Japan is apparently collecting a ""collection survey"" regarding the issue (translated from a Japanese tweet).

Here's the official report: https://i.imgur.com/WANV64y.jpg

**Here's our first battery expansion report -- in other words, this is REALLY bad for Sony: https://twitter.com/cardamon00/status/1577596298005741575**

---

EDIT 10/25/2022: Lots of US customers are reporting that Sony is no longer hassling them about out-of-warranty returns and is replacing the earbuds with no questions asked.

Thanks to everyone who has contributed to this thread! If anything changes, I'll update it.

Something else I've noticed is that the left and right earbuds now connect to my devices independently. In the past, the right earbud had to be active in order for either to connect. Can anyone else confirm this behavior?

---

EDIT 11/02/2022: It looks like this downgrade tool works with the XM4 buds: https://www.mrwalkman.com/p/mdrproxyfwsidegradetool.html?m=1

Use it at your own risk. Since the battery damage is likely permanent, this may not help.

If you're stuck with a 1.4.2 set and can't exchange it, using a charger with 500ma or less may prolong its life.

---

EDIT 11/16/2022: **One user reported that downgrading resolved the issues, and another user reported that Sony Support (EU) is claiming that a firmware update will be released this month to resolve the issue.**

This gives me some hope that the vast majority of the battery issues are not permanent and replacements won't be necessary going forward. For the time being, I'd continue with the replacement process. The worst-case scenario is that you have to wait a few weeks, but end up with a brand-new pair that should have a longer lifespan.

**NOTE 03/01/2023: This has proven to be untrue. For the vast majority of users, it appears that the damage done to the battery under firmware version 1.4.2 is permanent. Earlier/later firmware versions don't *cause* the battery issues, but they don't appear to fix them either.**

---

EDIT 01/24/2023: **Sony USA appears to have established a common process for addressing these RMAs with the following list of questions:**

1. Have you tried the reset process?
2. Is the unit getting hot while charging?
3. Is the red light blinking on the unit?

Replacements are being honored outside of the standard warranty period. Additionally, some users report that they were able to get replacements without their original proof of purchase.

---

EDIT 02/23/2023: One user reports that connecting to a VPN node in Japan allowed them to update to 1.6.1. The prompt appeared automatically shortly after connecting and opening the app.

**As predicted in my 10/06/2022 edit, we finally have our first report of an ""exploding"" earbud. To be honest, my guess is that battery expansion progressively weakened the epoxy seal, and it finally popped apart explosively (since there's no sign of puncture or charring of the battery/case), but it's still a really bad look for Sony, especially since multiple tech media outlets are reporting on it.**

**EDIT 02/27/2023: Firmware version 2.0.0 has been released globally with multipoint support and a roll-up of the previous battery fixes in 1.5.0 and 1.6.1.**

https://www.sony.com/electronics/support/wireless-headphones-bluetooth-headphones/wh-1000xm4/software/00289102

I updated my headset (from 1.5.0), so I'll update this thread with the results after I've used it for a week or so.

My initial impression is that the bluetooth multipoint works very well out of the box! What a relief to finally have this feature.

---

**EDIT 03/01/2023: Battery life appears to be shorter on 2.0.0 than 1.5.0 with my set that was never affected by the battery issues, however I am using multipoint. Other reviewers have reported that 1.6.1 slightly reduced battery life in an effort to limit strain on the battery.**

Some users who were affected by the battery issues and updated to 2.0.0 report longer battery life than 1.4.2, but not significantly so. Other users are reporting shorter battery life.

One user reports that 2.0.0 caused the battery drain issue to affect the opposite earbud(!?) We'll need further confirmation of this behavior.

Once again, I think it's important to emphasize that the damage to the batteries is probably already beyond the point of repair, and an RMA is your best option if you're still on 1.4.2.

--- 

**EDIT 03/01/2023 (2): Both myself and at least two are users are reporting that the battery life reported by the app changes significantly after placing the earbuds back into the case and removing them.** In one reported case, the reported battery life jumped from 1% -> 81%. In my case, with a set unaffected by the 1.4.2 battery issues, the right earbud went from 26% to 14% and left earbud from 47% to 31% after placing and removing them from the case. **This has been an issue off and on in multiple firmware versions, but it's concerning to see it return in 2.0.0.**

Despite the dramatic change in battery percentage, mine are still within a reasonable range of each other after ~6 hours of listening.

It's too early to say if this is a bigger issue, or if it will lead to the same battery issues as 1.4.2 did, but I'll make sure to keep this updated.

**I should also note, I haven't experienced any high temps while charging on 2.0.0.**

---

**EDIT 03/07/2023: While I'm still not experiencing any major issues on 2.0.0, *many* users are reporting that their battery life is FAR worse on 2.0.0 than 1.4.2.**

These are the issues I've noticed so far on 2.0.0 with my earbuds that were *unaffected* by the 1.4.2 battery life issues:

- Slightly reduced battery life versus 1.5.0
- Miscalculation of battery percentage until replaced/removed from case (present in older versions as well)
- Occasional bluetooth multipoint roaming issues that are likely caused by the audio source rather than the earbud firmware

---

**EDIT 03/23/2023: From the *many* new comments since the 2.0.0 update, the general consensus seems to be the following:**

- The 2.0.0 update doesn't introduce any *new* battery issues, however the multipoint feature will drain your battery faster if enabled.
- The 1.4.2 -> 2.0.0 upgrade path doesn't *fix* any of the battery issues on sets affected by them, and will make them substantially worse in most cases.
- RMAing your earbuds is the only *supported* option at this point. Downgrading will not fix your issues, but may result in a marginal improvement to battery life, and may prevent additional damage to the batteries. Replacing your batteries at home *will* fixed the issues in all *reported* instances, but runs a risk of failure/destruction of your headset, and voids any warranty.

**To answer the most commonly-asked questions:**

- Yes, it's safe to update from 1.5.0 or 1.6.2 to 2.0.0, but it's probably unnecessary unless you want to take advantage of the multipoint functionality.
- No, it is not safe to update from 1.4.2 to 2.0.0. Don't do it.
- Unless you're unable to, RMAing your earbuds is absolutely **the best option.**

One more note -- a user just reported that you are able to use the earbuds independently of each other if you disable the Google Assistant functionality! Pretty cool. It will also be interesting to see if this reduces the *normal* uneven battery drain effect.

---

**EDIT 03/31/2023: The uneven drain (~15% after 6+ hours of usage) on 2.0.0 with multipoint enabled was completely resolved when I disabled Google Assistant.**

I have been having some frustrating multipoint roaming issues where one of my Windows 11 PCs will occasionally no longer transmit sound unless I connect/disconnect multiple times in a certain order. This happens after another Windows 11 PC is connected.

---

EDIT 04/14/2023: Recently, I began having real difficulty getting sound output when switching between devices when using multi-point. My phone's output worked 100% of the time, but multiple computers I connect to required me to disconnect and reconnect through the app (not from bluetooth settings), or put the buds back in the case, then take them out and reconnect. It's almost as if they're recognized as two devices under the same ID.

Why am I adding this seemingly-irrelevant issue to the thread? Because even wiping my settings, turning off multi-point, and doing a factory reset didn't fix the issue, so I decided to downgrade to 1.6.1.

**I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS. The 2.0.0 -> 1.6.1 downgrade path breaks the touch-sensitive buttons, causing a voice output of ""device 2 replaced"" every time they're pressed.**

Upgrading to 2.0.0 again resolved that issue, but I have yet to confirm if my sound output and bluetooth roaming issues are resolved as well.

---

EDIT 04/20/2023: A user reported that you can resolve the touch-button issue on the 2.0.0 -> 1.6.1 downgrade path by reinstalling the English language package.

Essentially, Sony *may* have had a supply issue with the new model of batteries they wanted to use in the XM4 and ended up using the same batteries as the XM3. When the supply issues eased and they transitioned to the new batteries, a firmware update optimized for the increased voltage of the new batteries permanently damaged the earbuds using the older, lower-voltage batteries. This is a pretty convincing argument considering other pieces of information we've been drip-fed over the past year.

**EDIT 09/06/2023:** For those still interested in an RCA for the issue, one Reddit user reports that the explanation in the previous edit doesn't align with their experience. In their case, the battery issue was occurring despite their unit having the newer model of batteries: 

> Just replaced battery manually following youtube guides. I don't think the old model of battery is the problem because in my case the old battery which was causing the problem is the same model (Z55H) as the new one.

In another thread a Reddit user reported that Sony exchanged an RMA'd pair of XM4s for a new set of XM5s. Nice!

---

**EDIT 10/30/2023:** In the USA there's currently a 3-month backorder on WF-1000XM4 replacement sets. Sony is currently offering refunds to (presumably) *all* customers with a valid receipt.

---

**EDIT 11/03/2023:** I originally removed this from the post because I believed it to be speculation, but I've seen quite a few reports that there are similar battery issues affecting the WF-1000XM5s. In fact, one user reports that they've gone through multiple RMAs *and* that they have friends who've encountered the same issues on their XM5s.

To add to the frustration, it seems that the offer that Sony USA is giving XM4 RMA requesters (refunds or upgrades to the XM5) isn't being honored worldwide. A few users have even said that Sony isn't acknowledging *any* issues in certain countries.

--- 

**EDIT 02/14/2024:** One user reports that United Repairs has the parts for the XM4s back in stock, so they're repairing rather than replacing them.

**I've also seen additional reports of exploding earbuds over the past few months. I'd really recommend stopping use immediately.**",2022-09-06 21:49:30,"I had this problem for past 2 months. My right bud died within 30 mins of use. And it can never charge past 80%. My buds were 1-1/2 yr old. It was really frustrating, for the price I paid, I never had issue with other brands, and also much older earbuds (some are over 5 years old, still works perfectly).  


I did a battery replacement myself last night, and It worked out great. The battery is back to 100%, and charging normally. It was 10 min job if you have a good heat gun, and the battery cost me 12 USD including the tools.

But SONY it's very disappointing. I am not looking forward to upgrade to XM5 anytime soon, until it goes on heavy discount.",2023-03-07 04:53:46,Before
SonyHeadphones,WF-1000XM4 - Severe Battery Issues,"**PLEASE READ THE LATEST UPDATES AT THE BOTTOM OF THE THREAD. UPDATED NOV 3rd 2023.**

---

Starting at the end of July, there have been a large number of reports of *severe* uneven battery drain in the WF-1000XM4 earbuds. The common factor appears to be the 1.4.2 update. The most concerning symptom that some users have been reporting (myself included) is that the affected earbud is now getting hotter than expected while charging in the case.

See my running list of reports here **(has not been updated since Sep 2nd, 2022 - there are now thousands of reports)**: https://pastebin.com/H20eF2x6 Each post has numerous additional reports in the comment section. If we're seeing this much activity, it's safe to assume that this is a *much* bigger problem than represented by this subset of users.

I tried to bring this to the attention of Sony, but their call center managers unsurprisingly couldn't care less about escalating what could be a *major* issue. They *will* replace them with a brand new pair under warranty, but I have yet to receive mine and test them.

I've reached out to a number of high-profile reviewers and they're tracking this issue separately and attempting to replicate it on their end.

In fact, one user reports that they've gone through multiple RMAs *and* that they have friends who've encountered the same issues on their XM5s.

To add to the frustration, it seems that the offer that Sony USA is giving XM4 RMA requesters (refunds or upgrades to the XM5) isn't being honored worldwide. A few users have even said that Sony isn't acknowledging *any* issues in certain countries.

Starting at the end of July, there have been a large number of reports of *severe* uneven battery drain in the WF-1000XM4 earbuds. The common factor appears to be the 1.4.2 update. The most concerning symptom that some users have been reporting (myself included) is that the affected earbud is now getting hotter than expected while charging in the case.

See my running list of reports here **(has not been updated since Sep 2nd, 2022 - there are now thousands of reports)**: https://pastebin.com/H20eF2x6 Each post has numerous additional reports in the comment section. If we're seeing this much activity, it's safe to assume that this is a *much* bigger problem than represented by this subset of users.

I tried to bring this to the attention of Sony, but their call center managers unsurprisingly couldn't care less about escalating what could be a *major* issue. They *will* replace them with a brand new pair under warranty, but I have yet to receive mine and test them.

I've reached out to a number of high-profile reviewers and they're tracking this issue separately and attempting to replicate it on their end.

---

EDIT 9/7/2022: Added additional reports.

---

EDIT 9/14/2022: Added lots of additional reports. New warranty-exhange earbuds arrived with firmware version 1.5.0 installed. I'll let everyone know if the issue persists.

---

EDIT 9/16/2022: My brand new pair that shipped with 1.5.0 doesn't appear to be having the same issue (yet). There's still a ~5% difference after a few hours of use, but that's probably due to the extra processing being performed in the right earbud. I'll update this after I try to drain the case/earbuds to 0%, charge, and test again.

Note: Several people have reported that the issue is *still* present on their warranty-replacement pair, so take my update with a grain of salt.

---

EDIT 9/28/2022: The new pair that shipped with 1.5.0 *still* hasn't experienced any issues with battery life or overheating. I'm curious if maybe these ones never had 1.4.2 on them, and some of the users who reported issues with their 1.5.0 pair had them upgraded from 1.4.2 in the factory.

---

EDIT 9/29/2022: Another thought - if we're all experiencing some form of overheating while charging since upgrading to 1.4.2 (whether we catch it happening or not) this could be causing permanent damage to the battery in the affected earbud. 

This might also explain why some users running 1.5.0 have reported the issue: if it was charged in-factory while running 1.4.2, overheated, and was upgraded to 1.5.0 prior to shipping, that could explain why the issue persists.

I'll be very curious to see if the issue persists with users who upgrade to 1.5.0 after it's publicly available.

---

EDIT 10/06/2022: Added at least a dozen brand new reports from Japan. My guess is that the 1.4.2 update just released there.

Sony Japan is apparently collecting a ""collection survey"" regarding the issue (translated from a Japanese tweet).

Here's the official report: https://i.imgur.com/WANV64y.jpg

EDIT 10/25/2022: Lots of US customers are reporting that Sony is no longer hassling them about out-of-warranty returns and is replacing the earbuds with no questions asked.

Thanks to everyone who has contributed to this thread! If anything changes, I'll update it.

Something else I've noticed is that the left and right earbuds now connect to my devices independently. In the past, the right earbud had to be active in order for either to connect. Can anyone else confirm this behavior?

---

EDIT 11/02/2022: It looks like this downgrade tool works with the XM4 buds: https://www.mrwalkman.com/p/mdrproxyfwsidegradetool.html?m=1

Use it at your own risk. Since the battery damage is likely permanent, this may not help.

If you're stuck with a 1.4.2 set and can't exchange it, using a charger with 500ma or less may prolong its life.

---

EDIT 11/16/2022: **One user reported that downgrading resolved the issues, and another user reported that Sony Support (EU) is claiming that a firmware update will be released this month to resolve the issue.**

This gives me some hope that the vast majority of the battery issues are not permanent and replacements won't be necessary going forward. For the time being, I'd continue with the replacement process. The worst-case scenario is that you have to wait a few weeks, but end up with a brand-new pair that should have a longer lifespan.

**NOTE 03/01/2023: This has proven to be untrue. For the vast majority of users, it appears that the damage done to the battery under firmware version 1.4.2 is permanent. Earlier/later firmware versions don't *cause* the battery issues, but they don't appear to fix them either.**

---

EDIT 01/24/2023: **Sony USA appears to have established a common process for addressing these RMAs with the following list of questions:**

1. Have you tried the reset process?
2. Is the unit getting hot while charging?
3. Is the red light blinking on the unit?

Replacements are being honored outside of the standard warranty period. Additionally, some users report that they were able to get replacements without their original proof of purchase.

https://www.sony.com/electronics/support/wireless-headphones-bluetooth-headphones/wh-1000xm4/software/00289102

I updated my headset (from 1.5.0), so I'll update this thread with the results after I've used it for a week or so.

My initial impression is that the bluetooth multipoint works very well out of the box! What a relief to finally have this feature.

---

**EDIT 03/01/2023: Battery life appears to be shorter on 2.0.0 than 1.5.0 with my set that was never affected by the battery issues, however I am using multipoint. Other reviewers have reported that 1.6.1 slightly reduced battery life in an effort to limit strain on the battery.**

Some users who were affected by the battery issues and updated to 2.0.0 report longer battery life than 1.4.2, but not significantly so. Other users are reporting shorter battery life.

One user reports that 2.0.0 caused the battery drain issue to affect the opposite earbud(!?) We'll need further confirmation of this behavior.

Once again, I think it's important to emphasize that the damage to the batteries is probably already beyond the point of repair, and an RMA is your best option if you're still on 1.4.2.

--- 

**EDIT 03/01/2023 (2): Both myself and at least two are users are reporting that the battery life reported by the app changes significantly after placing the earbuds back into the case and removing them.** In one reported case, the reported battery life jumped from 1% -> 81%. In my case, with a set unaffected by the 1.4.2 battery issues, the right earbud went from 26% to 14% and left earbud from 47% to 31% after placing and removing them from the case. **This has been an issue off and on in multiple firmware versions, but it's concerning to see it return in 2.0.0.**

Despite the dramatic change in battery percentage, mine are still within a reasonable range of each other after ~6 hours of listening.

It's too early to say if this is a bigger issue, or if it will lead to the same battery issues as 1.4.2 did, but I'll make sure to keep this updated.

**I should also note, I haven't experienced any high temps while charging on 2.0.0.**

---

**EDIT 03/07/2023: While I'm still not experiencing any major issues on 2.0.0, *many* users are reporting that their battery life is FAR worse on 2.0.0 than 1.4.2.**

These are the issues I've noticed so far on 2.0.0 with my earbuds that were *unaffected* by the 1.4.2 battery life issues:

- Slightly reduced battery life versus 1.5.0
- Miscalculation of battery percentage until replaced/removed from case (present in older versions as well)
- Occasional bluetooth multipoint roaming issues that are likely caused by the audio source rather than the earbud firmware

---

**EDIT 03/23/2023: From the *many* new comments since the 2.0.0 update, the general consensus seems to be the following:**

- The 2.0.0 update doesn't introduce any *new* battery issues, however the multipoint feature will drain your battery faster if enabled.
- The 1.4.2 -> 2.0.0 upgrade path doesn't *fix* any of the battery issues on sets affected by them, and will make them substantially worse in most cases.
- RMAing your earbuds is the only *supported* option at this point. Downgrading will not fix your issues, but may result in a marginal improvement to battery life, and may prevent additional damage to the batteries. Replacing your batteries at home *will* fixed the issues in all *reported* instances, but runs a risk of failure/destruction of your headset, and voids any warranty.

**To answer the most commonly-asked questions:**

- Yes, it's safe to update from 1.5.0 or 1.6.2 to 2.0.0, but it's probably unnecessary unless you want to take advantage of the multipoint functionality.
- No, it is not safe to update from 1.4.2 to 2.0.0. Don't do it.
- Unless you're unable to, RMAing your earbuds is absolutely **the best option.**

One more note -- a user just reported that you are able to use the earbuds independently of each other if you disable the Google Assistant functionality! Pretty cool. It will also be interesting to see if this reduces the *normal* uneven battery drain effect.

---

**EDIT 03/31/2023: The uneven drain (~15% after 6+ hours of usage) on 2.0.0 with multipoint enabled was completely resolved when I disabled Google Assistant.**

I have been having some frustrating multipoint roaming issues where one of my Windows 11 PCs will occasionally no longer transmit sound unless I connect/disconnect multiple times in a certain order. This happens after another Windows 11 PC is connected.

---

EDIT 04/14/2023: Recently, I began having real difficulty getting sound output when switching between devices when using multi-point. My phone's output worked 100% of the time, but multiple computers I connect to required me to disconnect and reconnect through the app (not from bluetooth settings), or put the buds back in the case, then take them out and reconnect. It's almost as if they're recognized as two devices under the same ID.

Why am I adding this seemingly-irrelevant issue to the thread? Because even wiping my settings, turning off multi-point, and doing a factory reset didn't fix the issue, so I decided to downgrade to 1.6.1.

**I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS. The 2.0.0 -> 1.6.1 downgrade path breaks the touch-sensitive buttons, causing a voice output of ""device 2 replaced"" every time they're pressed.**

Upgrading to 2.0.0 again resolved that issue, but I have yet to confirm if my sound output and bluetooth roaming issues are resolved as well.

---

EDIT 04/20/2023: A user reported that you can resolve the touch-button issue on the 2.0.0 -> 1.6.1 downgrade path by reinstalling the English language package.

Essentially, Sony *may* have had a supply issue with the new model of batteries they wanted to use in the XM4 and ended up using the same batteries as the XM3. When the supply issues eased and they transitioned to the new batteries, a firmware update optimized for the increased voltage of the new batteries permanently damaged the earbuds using the older, lower-voltage batteries. This is a pretty convincing argument considering other pieces of information we've been drip-fed over the past year.

**UPDATE 9/14/2023: This theory has been pretty thoroughly refuted by new evidence.**

---

**EDIT 09/06/2023:** For those still interested in an RCA for the issue, one Reddit user reports that the explanation in the previous edit doesn't align with their experience. In their case, the battery issue was occurring despite their unit having the newer model of batteries: 

> Just replaced battery manually following youtube guides. I don't think the old model of battery is the problem because in my case the old battery which was causing the problem is the same model (Z55H) as the new one.

In another thread a Reddit user reported that Sony exchanged an RMA'd pair of XM4s for a new set of XM5s. Nice!

---

**EDIT 10/30/2023:** In the USA there's currently a 3-month backorder on WF-1000XM4 replacement sets. Sony is currently offering refunds to (presumably) *all* customers with a valid receipt.

To add to the frustration, it seems that the offer that Sony USA is giving XM4 RMA requesters (refunds or upgrades to the XM5) isn't being honored worldwide. A few users have even said that Sony isn't acknowledging *any* issues in certain countries.

Essentially, Sony *may* have had a supply issue with the new model of batteries they wanted to use in the XM4 and ended up using the same batteries as the XM3. When the supply issues eased and they transitioned to the new batteries, a firmware update optimized for the increased voltage of the new batteries permanently damaged the earbuds using the older, lower-voltage batteries. This is a pretty convincing argument considering other pieces of information we've been drip-fed over the past year.

In another thread a Reddit user reported that Sony exchanged an RMA'd pair of XM4s for a new set of XM5s. Nice!

To add to the frustration, it seems that the offer that Sony USA is giving XM4 RMA requesters (refunds or upgrades to the XM5) isn't being honored worldwide. A few users have even said that Sony isn't acknowledging *any* issues in certain countries.

Starting at the end of July, there have been a large number of reports of *severe* uneven battery drain in the WF-1000XM4 earbuds. The common factor appears to be the 1.4.2 update. The most concerning symptom that some users have been reporting (myself included) is that the affected earbud is now getting hotter than expected while charging in the case.

See my running list of reports here **(has not been updated since Sep 2nd, 2022 - there are now thousands of reports)**: https://pastebin.com/H20eF2x6 Each post has numerous additional reports in the comment section. If we're seeing this much activity, it's safe to assume that this is a *much* bigger problem than represented by this subset of users.

I tried to bring this to the attention of Sony, but their call center managers unsurprisingly couldn't care less about escalating what could be a *major* issue. They *will* replace them with a brand new pair under warranty, but I have yet to receive mine and test them.

I've reached out to a number of high-profile reviewers and they're tracking this issue separately and attempting to replicate it on their end.

---

EDIT 9/7/2022: Added additional reports.

---

EDIT 9/14/2022: Added lots of additional reports. New warranty-exhange earbuds arrived with firmware version 1.5.0 installed. I'll let everyone know if the issue persists.

---

EDIT 9/16/2022: My brand new pair that shipped with 1.5.0 doesn't appear to be having the same issue (yet). There's still a ~5% difference after a few hours of use, but that's probably due to the extra processing being performed in the right earbud. I'll update this after I try to drain the case/earbuds to 0%, charge, and test again.

Note: Several people have reported that the issue is *still* present on their warranty-replacement pair, so take my update with a grain of salt.

---

EDIT 9/28/2022: The new pair that shipped with 1.5.0 *still* hasn't experienced any issues with battery life or overheating. I'm curious if maybe these ones never had 1.4.2 on them, and some of the users who reported issues with their 1.5.0 pair had them upgraded from 1.4.2 in the factory.

---

EDIT 9/29/2022: Another thought - if we're all experiencing some form of overheating while charging since upgrading to 1.4.2 (whether we catch it happening or not) this could be causing permanent damage to the battery in the affected earbud. 

This might also explain why some users running 1.5.0 have reported the issue: if it was charged in-factory while running 1.4.2, overheated, and was upgraded to 1.5.0 prior to shipping, that could explain why the issue persists.

I'll be very curious to see if the issue persists with users who upgrade to 1.5.0 after it's publicly available.

---

EDIT 10/06/2022: Added at least a dozen brand new reports from Japan. My guess is that the 1.4.2 update just released there.

Sony Japan is apparently collecting a ""collection survey"" regarding the issue (translated from a Japanese tweet).

Here's the official report: https://i.imgur.com/WANV64y.jpg

EDIT 10/25/2022: Lots of US customers are reporting that Sony is no longer hassling them about out-of-warranty returns and is replacing the earbuds with no questions asked.

Thanks to everyone who has contributed to this thread! If anything changes, I'll update it.

Something else I've noticed is that the left and right earbuds now connect to my devices independently. In the past, the right earbud had to be active in order for either to connect. Can anyone else confirm this behavior?

---

EDIT 11/02/2022: It looks like this downgrade tool works with the XM4 buds: https://www.mrwalkman.com/p/mdrproxyfwsidegradetool.html?m=1

Use it at your own risk. Since the battery damage is likely permanent, this may not help.

If you're stuck with a 1.4.2 set and can't exchange it, using a charger with 500ma or less may prolong its life.

---

EDIT 11/16/2022: **One user reported that downgrading resolved the issues, and another user reported that Sony Support (EU) is claiming that a firmware update will be released this month to resolve the issue.**

This gives me some hope that the vast majority of the battery issues are not permanent and replacements won't be necessary going forward. For the time being, I'd continue with the replacement process. The worst-case scenario is that you have to wait a few weeks, but end up with a brand-new pair that should have a longer lifespan.

**NOTE 03/01/2023: This has proven to be untrue. For the vast majority of users, it appears that the damage done to the battery under firmware version 1.4.2 is permanent. Earlier/later firmware versions don't *cause* the battery issues, but they don't appear to fix them either.**

---

EDIT 01/24/2023: **Sony USA appears to have established a common process for addressing these RMAs with the following list of questions:**

1. Have you tried the reset process?
2. Is the unit getting hot while charging?
3. Is the red light blinking on the unit?

Replacements are being honored outside of the standard warranty period. Additionally, some users report that they were able to get replacements without their original proof of purchase.

EDIT 02/23/2023: One user reports that connecting to a VPN node in Japan allowed them to update to 1.6.1. The prompt appeared automatically shortly after connecting and opening the app.

**EDIT 02/27/2023: Firmware version 2.0.0 has been released globally with multipoint support and a roll-up of the previous battery fixes in 1.5.0 and 1.6.1.**

https://www.sony.com/electronics/support/wireless-headphones-bluetooth-headphones/wh-1000xm4/software/00289102

I updated my headset (from 1.5.0), so I'll update this thread with the results after I've used it for a week or so.

My initial impression is that the bluetooth multipoint works very well out of the box! What a relief to finally have this feature.

---

**EDIT 03/01/2023: Battery life appears to be shorter on 2.0.0 than 1.5.0 with my set that was never affected by the battery issues, however I am using multipoint. Other reviewers have reported that 1.6.1 slightly reduced battery life in an effort to limit strain on the battery.**

Some users who were affected by the battery issues and updated to 2.0.0 report longer battery life than 1.4.2, but not significantly so. Other users are reporting shorter battery life.

One user reports that 2.0.0 caused the battery drain issue to affect the opposite earbud(!?) We'll need further confirmation of this behavior.

Once again, I think it's important to emphasize that the damage to the batteries is probably already beyond the point of repair, and an RMA is your best option if you're still on 1.4.2.

--- 

**EDIT 03/01/2023 (2): Both myself and at least two are users are reporting that the battery life reported by the app changes significantly after placing the earbuds back into the case and removing them.** In one reported case, the reported battery life jumped from 1% -> 81%. In my case, with a set unaffected by the 1.4.2 battery issues, the right earbud went from 26% to 14% and left earbud from 47% to 31% after placing and removing them from the case. **This has been an issue off and on in multiple firmware versions, but it's concerning to see it return in 2.0.0.**

Despite the dramatic change in battery percentage, mine are still within a reasonable range of each other after ~6 hours of listening.

It's too early to say if this is a bigger issue, or if it will lead to the same battery issues as 1.4.2 did, but I'll make sure to keep this updated.

**I should also note, I haven't experienced any high temps while charging on 2.0.0.**

---

**EDIT 03/07/2023: While I'm still not experiencing any major issues on 2.0.0, *many* users are reporting that their battery life is FAR worse on 2.0.0 than 1.4.2.**

These are the issues I've noticed so far on 2.0.0 with my earbuds that were *unaffected* by the 1.4.2 battery life issues:

- Slightly reduced battery life versus 1.5.0
- Miscalculation of battery percentage until replaced/removed from case (present in older versions as well)
- Occasional bluetooth multipoint roaming issues that are likely caused by the audio source rather than the earbud firmware

---

**EDIT 03/23/2023: From the *many* new comments since the 2.0.0 update, the general consensus seems to be the following:**

- The 2.0.0 update doesn't introduce any *new* battery issues, however the multipoint feature will drain your battery faster if enabled.
- The 1.4.2 -> 2.0.0 upgrade path doesn't *fix* any of the battery issues on sets affected by them, and will make them substantially worse in most cases.
- RMAing your earbuds is the only *supported* option at this point. Downgrading will not fix your issues, but may result in a marginal improvement to battery life, and may prevent additional damage to the batteries. Replacing your batteries at home *will* fixed the issues in all *reported* instances, but runs a risk of failure/destruction of your headset, and voids any warranty.

**To answer the most commonly-asked questions:**

- Yes, it's safe to update from 1.5.0 or 1.6.2 to 2.0.0, but it's probably unnecessary unless you want to take advantage of the multipoint functionality.
- No, it is not safe to update from 1.4.2 to 2.0.0. Don't do it.
- Unless you're unable to, RMAing your earbuds is absolutely **the best option.**

One more note -- a user just reported that you are able to use the earbuds independently of each other if you disable the Google Assistant functionality! Pretty cool. It will also be interesting to see if this reduces the *normal* uneven battery drain effect.

---

**EDIT 03/31/2023: The uneven drain (~15% after 6+ hours of usage) on 2.0.0 with multipoint enabled was completely resolved when I disabled Google Assistant.**

I have been having some frustrating multipoint roaming issues where one of my Windows 11 PCs will occasionally no longer transmit sound unless I connect/disconnect multiple times in a certain order. This happens after another Windows 11 PC is connected.

---

EDIT 04/14/2023: Recently, I began having real difficulty getting sound output when switching between devices when using multi-point. My phone's output worked 100% of the time, but multiple computers I connect to required me to disconnect and reconnect through the app (not from bluetooth settings), or put the buds back in the case, then take them out and reconnect. It's almost as if they're recognized as two devices under the same ID.

Why am I adding this seemingly-irrelevant issue to the thread? Because even wiping my settings, turning off multi-point, and doing a factory reset didn't fix the issue, so I decided to downgrade to 1.6.1.

**I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS. The 2.0.0 -> 1.6.1 downgrade path breaks the touch-sensitive buttons, causing a voice output of ""device 2 replaced"" every time they're pressed.**

Upgrading to 2.0.0 again resolved that issue, but I have yet to confirm if my sound output and bluetooth roaming issues are resolved as well.

---

EDIT 04/20/2023: A user reported that you can resolve the touch-button issue on the 2.0.0 -> 1.6.1 downgrade path by reinstalling the English language package.

Another user reported that changing the language in the headphones app under Notification & Voice Guide to another language and then back to English fixed it.

I have been having some frustrating multipoint roaming issues where one of my Windows 11 PCs will occasionally no longer transmit sound unless I connect/disconnect multiple times in a certain order. This happens after another Windows 11 PC is connected.

---

EDIT 04/14/2023: Recently, I began having real difficulty getting sound output when switching between devices when using multi-point. My phone's output worked 100% of the time, but multiple computers I connect to required me to disconnect and reconnect through the app (not from bluetooth settings), or put the buds back in the case, then take them out and reconnect. It's almost as if they're recognized as two devices under the same ID.

Why am I adding this seemingly-irrelevant issue to the thread? Because even wiping my settings, turning off multi-point, and doing a factory reset didn't fix the issue, so I decided to downgrade to 1.6.1.

**I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS. The 2.0.0 -> 1.6.1 downgrade path breaks the touch-sensitive buttons, causing a voice output of ""device 2 replaced"" every time they're pressed.**

Upgrading to 2.0.0 again resolved that issue, but I have yet to confirm if my sound output and bluetooth roaming issues are resolved as well.

Essentially, Sony *may* have had a supply issue with the new model of batteries they wanted to use in the XM4 and ended up using the same batteries as the XM3. When the supply issues eased and they transitioned to the new batteries, a firmware update optimized for the increased voltage of the new batteries permanently damaged the earbuds using the older, lower-voltage batteries. This is a pretty convincing argument considering other pieces of information we've been drip-fed over the past year.

Starting at the end of July, there have been a large number of reports of *severe* uneven battery drain in the WF-1000XM4 earbuds. The common factor appears to be the 1.4.2 update. The most concerning symptom that some users have been reporting (myself included) is that the affected earbud is now getting hotter than expected while charging in the case.

See my running list of reports here **(has not been updated since Sep 2nd, 2022 - there are now thousands of reports)**: https://pastebin.com/H20eF2x6 Each post has numerous additional reports in the comment section. If we're seeing this much activity, it's safe to assume that this is a *much* bigger problem than represented by this subset of users.

I tried to bring this to the attention of Sony, but their call center managers unsurprisingly couldn't care less about escalating what could be a *major* issue. They *will* replace them with a brand new pair under warranty, but I have yet to receive mine and test them.

I've reached out to a number of high-profile reviewers and they're tracking this issue separately and attempting to replicate it on their end.

---

EDIT 9/7/2022: Added additional reports.

---

EDIT 9/14/2022: Added lots of additional reports. New warranty-exhange earbuds arrived with firmware version 1.5.0 installed. I'll let everyone know if the issue persists.

---

EDIT 9/16/2022: My brand new pair that shipped with 1.5.0 doesn't appear to be having the same issue (yet). There's still a ~5% difference after a few hours of use, but that's probably due to the extra processing being performed in the right earbud. I'll update this after I try to drain the case/earbuds to 0%, charge, and test again.

Note: Several people have reported that the issue is *still* present on their warranty-replacement pair, so take my update with a grain of salt.

---

EDIT 9/28/2022: The new pair that shipped with 1.5.0 *still* hasn't experienced any issues with battery life or overheating. I'm curious if maybe these ones never had 1.4.2 on them, and some of the users who reported issues with their 1.5.0 pair had them upgraded from 1.4.2 in the factory.

---

EDIT 9/29/2022: Another thought - if we're all experiencing some form of overheating while charging since upgrading to 1.4.2 (whether we catch it happening or not) this could be causing permanent damage to the battery in the affected earbud. 

This might also explain why some users running 1.5.0 have reported the issue: if it was charged in-factory while running 1.4.2, overheated, and was upgraded to 1.5.0 prior to shipping, that could explain why the issue persists.

I'll be very curious to see if the issue persists with users who upgrade to 1.5.0 after it's publicly available.

---

EDIT 10/06/2022: Added at least a dozen brand new reports from Japan. My guess is that the 1.4.2 update just released there.

Use it at your own risk. Since the battery damage is likely permanent, this may not help.

If you're stuck with a 1.4.2 set and can't exchange it, using a charger with 500ma or less may prolong its life.

---

EDIT 11/16/2022: **One user reported that downgrading resolved the issues, and another user reported that Sony Support (EU) is claiming that a firmware update will be released this month to resolve the issue.**

For the time being, I'd continue with the replacement process. The worst-case scenario is that you have to wait a few weeks, but end up with a brand-new pair that should have a longer lifespan.

**NOTE 03/01/2023: This has proven to be untrue. For the vast majority of users, it appears that the damage done to the battery under firmware version 1.4.2 is permanent. Earlier/later firmware versions don't *cause* the battery issues, but they don't appear to fix them either.**

https://www.sony.com/electronics/support/wireless-headphones-bluetooth-headphones/wh-1000xm4/software/00289102

I updated my headset (from 1.5.0), so I'll update this thread with the results after I've used it for a week or so.

My initial impression is that the bluetooth multipoint works very well out of the box! What a relief to finally have this feature.

---

**EDIT 03/01/2023: Battery life appears to be shorter on 2.0.0 than 1.5.0 with my set that was never affected by the battery issues, however I am using multipoint. Other reviewers have reported that 1.6.1 slightly reduced battery life in an effort to limit strain on the battery.**

Some users who were affected by the battery issues and updated to 2.0.0 report longer battery life than 1.4.2, but not significantly so. Other users are reporting shorter battery life.

One user reports that 2.0.0 caused the battery drain issue to affect the opposite earbud(!?) We'll need further confirmation of this behavior.

Once again, I think it's important to emphasize that the damage to the batteries is probably already beyond the point of repair, and an RMA is your best option if you're still on 1.4.2.

--- 

**EDIT 03/01/2023 (2): Both myself and at least two are users are reporting that the battery life reported by the app changes significantly after placing the earbuds back into the case and removing them.** In one reported case, the reported battery life jumped from 1% -> 81%. In my case, with a set unaffected by the 1.4.2 battery issues, the right earbud went from 26% to 14% and left earbud from 47% to 31% after placing and removing them from the case. **This has been an issue off and on in multiple firmware versions, but it's concerning to see it return in 2.0.0.**

Despite the dramatic change in battery percentage, mine are still within a reasonable range of each other after ~6 hours of listening.

It's too early to say if this is a bigger issue, or if it will lead to the same battery issues as 1.4.2 did, but I'll make sure to keep this updated.

**I should also note, I haven't experienced any high temps while charging on 2.0.0.**

---

**EDIT 03/07/2023: While I'm still not experiencing any major issues on 2.0.0, *many* users are reporting that their battery life is FAR worse on 2.0.0 than 1.4.2.**

These are the issues I've noticed so far on 2.0.0 with my earbuds that were *unaffected* by the 1.4.2 battery life issues:

- Slightly reduced battery life versus 1.5.0
- Miscalculation of battery percentage until replaced/removed from case (present in older versions as well)
- Occasional bluetooth multipoint roaming issues that are likely caused by the audio source rather than the earbud firmware

---

**EDIT 03/23/2023: From the *many* new comments since the 2.0.0 update, the general consensus seems to be the following:**

- The 2.0.0 update doesn't introduce any *new* battery issues, however the multipoint feature will drain your battery faster if enabled.
- The 1.4.2 -> 2.0.0 upgrade path doesn't *fix* any of the battery issues on sets affected by them, and will make them substantially worse in most cases.
- RMAing your earbuds is the only *supported* option at this point. Downgrading will not fix your issues, but may result in a marginal improvement to battery life, and may prevent additional damage to the batteries. Replacing your batteries at home *will* fixed the issues in all *reported* instances, but runs a risk of failure/destruction of your headset, and voids any warranty.

**To answer the most commonly-asked questions:**

- Yes, it's safe to update from 1.5.0 or 1.6.2 to 2.0.0, but it's probably unnecessary unless you want to take advantage of the multipoint functionality.
- No, it is not safe to update from 1.4.2 to 2.0.0. Don't do it.
- Unless you're unable to, RMAing your earbuds is absolutely **the best option.**

One more note -- a user just reported that you are able to use the earbuds independently of each other if you disable the Google Assistant functionality! Pretty cool. It will also be interesting to see if this reduces the *normal* uneven battery drain effect.

**I should also note, I haven't experienced any high temps while charging on 2.0.0.**

---

**EDIT 03/07/2023: While I'm still not experiencing any major issues on 2.0.0, *many* users are reporting that their battery life is FAR worse on 2.0.0 than 1.4.2.**

These are the issues I've noticed so far on 2.0.0 with my earbuds that were *unaffected* by the 1.4.2 battery life issues:

- Slightly reduced battery life versus 1.5.0
- Miscalculation of battery percentage until replaced/removed from case (present in older versions as well)
- Occasional bluetooth multipoint roaming issues that are likely caused by the audio source rather than the earbud firmware

---

**EDIT 03/23/2023: From the *many* new comments since the 2.0.0 update, the general consensus seems to be the following:**

- The 2.0.0 update doesn't introduce any *new* battery issues, however the multipoint feature will drain your battery faster if enabled.
- The 1.4.2 -> 2.0.0 upgrade path doesn't *fix* any of the battery issues on sets affected by them, and will make them substantially worse in most cases.
- RMAing your earbuds is the only *supported* option at this point. Downgrading will not fix your issues, but may result in a marginal improvement to battery life, and may prevent additional damage to the batteries. Replacing your batteries at home *will* fixed the issues in all *reported* instances, but runs a risk of failure/destruction of your headset, and voids any warranty.

**To answer the most commonly-asked questions:**

- Yes, it's safe to update from 1.5.0 or 1.6.2 to 2.0.0, but it's probably unnecessary unless you want to take advantage of the multipoint functionality.
- No, it is not safe to update from 1.4.2 to 2.0.0. Don't do it.
- Unless you're unable to, RMAing your earbuds is absolutely **the best option.**

One more note -- a user just reported that you are able to use the earbuds independently of each other if you disable the Google Assistant functionality! Pretty cool. It will also be interesting to see if this reduces the *normal* uneven battery drain effect.

---

**EDIT 03/31/2023: The uneven drain (~15% after 6+ hours of usage) on 2.0.0 with multipoint enabled was completely resolved when I disabled Google Assistant.**

I have been having some frustrating multipoint roaming issues where one of my Windows 11 PCs will occasionally no longer transmit sound unless I connect/disconnect multiple times in a certain order. This happens after another Windows 11 PC is connected.

---

EDIT 04/14/2023: Recently, I began having real difficulty getting sound output when switching between devices when using multi-point. My phone's output worked 100% of the time, but multiple computers I connect to required me to disconnect and reconnect through the app (not from bluetooth settings), or put the buds back in the case, then take them out and reconnect. It's almost as if they're recognized as two devices under the same ID.

Why am I adding this seemingly-irrelevant issue to the thread? Because even wiping my settings, turning off multi-point, and doing a factory reset didn't fix the issue, so I decided to downgrade to 1.6.1.

**I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS. The 2.0.0 -> 1.6.1 downgrade path breaks the touch-sensitive buttons, causing a voice output of ""device 2 replaced"" every time they're pressed.**

Upgrading to 2.0.0 again resolved that issue, but I have yet to confirm if my sound output and bluetooth roaming issues are resolved as well.

SonyHeadphones,WF-1000XM4 - Severe Battery Issues,"**PLEASE READ THE LATEST UPDATES AT THE BOTTOM OF THE THREAD. UPDATED NOV 3rd 2023.**

---

Starting at the end of July, there have been a large number of reports of *severe* uneven battery drain in the WF-1000XM4 earbuds. The common factor appears to be the 1.4.2 update. The most concerning symptom that some users have been reporting (myself included) is that the affected earbud is now getting hotter than expected while charging in the case.

See my running list of reports here **(has not been updated since Sep 2nd, 2022 - there are now thousands of reports)**: https://pastebin.com/H20eF2x6 Each post has numerous additional reports in the comment section. If we're seeing this much activity, it's safe to assume that this is a *much* bigger problem than represented by this subset of users.

I tried to bring this to the attention of Sony, but their call center managers unsurprisingly couldn't care less about escalating what could be a *major* issue. They *will* replace them with a brand new pair under warranty, but I have yet to receive mine and test them.

I've reached out to a number of high-profile reviewers and they're tracking this issue separately and attempting to replicate it on their end.

---

EDIT 9/7/2022: Added additional reports.

---

EDIT 9/14/2022: Added lots of additional reports. New warranty-exhange earbuds arrived with firmware version 1.5.0 installed. I'll let everyone know if the issue persists.

---

EDIT 9/16/2022: My brand new pair that shipped with 1.5.0 doesn't appear to be having the same issue (yet). There's still a ~5% difference after a few hours of use, but that's probably due to the extra processing being performed in the right earbud. I'll update this after I try to drain the case/earbuds to 0%, charge, and test again.

Note: Several people have reported that the issue is *still* present on their warranty-replacement pair, so take my update with a grain of salt.

---

EDIT 9/28/2022: The new pair that shipped with 1.5.0 *still* hasn't experienced any issues with battery life or overheating. I'm curious if maybe these ones never had 1.4.2 on them, and some of the users who reported issues with their 1.5.0 pair had them upgraded from 1.4.2 in the factory.

---

EDIT 9/29/2022: Another thought - if we're all experiencing some form of overheating while charging since upgrading to 1.4.2 (whether we catch it happening or not) this could be causing permanent damage to the battery in the affected earbud. 

This might also explain why some users running 1.5.0 have reported the issue: if it was charged in-factory while running 1.4.2, overheated, and was upgraded to 1.5.0 prior to shipping, that could explain why the issue persists.

I'll be very curious to see if the issue persists with users who upgrade to 1.5.0 after it's publicly available.

---

EDIT 10/06/2022: Added at least a dozen brand new reports from Japan. My guess is that the 1.4.2 update just released there.

Sony Japan is apparently collecting a ""collection survey"" regarding the issue (translated from a Japanese tweet).

Here's the official report: https://i.imgur.com/WANV64y.jpg

**Here's our first battery expansion report -- in other words, this is REALLY bad for Sony: https://twitter.com/cardamon00/status/1577596298005741575**

---

EDIT 10/25/2022: Lots of US customers are reporting that Sony is no longer hassling them about out-of-warranty returns and is replacing the earbuds with no questions asked.

Thanks to everyone who has contributed to this thread! If anything changes, I'll update it.

Something else I've noticed is that the left and right earbuds now connect to my devices independently. In the past, the right earbud had to be active in order for either to connect. Can anyone else confirm this behavior?

---

EDIT 11/02/2022: It looks like this downgrade tool works with the XM4 buds: https://www.mrwalkman.com/p/mdrproxyfwsidegradetool.html?m=1

Use it at your own risk. Since the battery damage is likely permanent, this may not help.

If you're stuck with a 1.4.2 set and can't exchange it, using a charger with 500ma or less may prolong its life.

---

EDIT 11/16/2022: **One user reported that downgrading resolved the issues, and another user reported that Sony Support (EU) is claiming that a firmware update will be released this month to resolve the issue.**

This gives me some hope that the vast majority of the battery issues are not permanent and replacements won't be necessary going forward. For the time being, I'd continue with the replacement process. The worst-case scenario is that you have to wait a few weeks, but end up with a brand-new pair that should have a longer lifespan.

**NOTE 03/01/2023: This has proven to be untrue. For the vast majority of users, it appears that the damage done to the battery under firmware version 1.4.2 is permanent. Earlier/later firmware versions don't *cause* the battery issues, but they don't appear to fix them either.**

---

EDIT 01/24/2023: **Sony USA appears to have established a common process for addressing these RMAs with the following list of questions:**

1. Have you tried the reset process?
2. Is the unit getting hot while charging?
3. Is the red light blinking on the unit?

Replacements are being honored outside of the standard warranty period. Additionally, some users report that they were able to get replacements without their original proof of purchase.

---

EDIT 02/23/2023: One user reports that connecting to a VPN node in Japan allowed them to update to 1.6.1. The prompt appeared automatically shortly after connecting and opening the app.

**As predicted in my 10/06/2022 edit, we finally have our first report of an ""exploding"" earbud. To be honest, my guess is that battery expansion progressively weakened the epoxy seal, and it finally popped apart explosively (since there's no sign of puncture or charring of the battery/case), but it's still a really bad look for Sony, especially since multiple tech media outlets are reporting on it.**

https://www.reddit.com/r/SonyHeadphones/comments/117ueiy/wf1000xm4_battery_exploded_while_in_charging_case/

---

**EDIT 02/27/2023: Firmware version 2.0.0 has been released globally with multipoint support and a roll-up of the previous battery fixes in 1.5.0 and 1.6.1.**

https://www.sony.com/electronics/support/wireless-headphones-bluetooth-headphones/wh-1000xm4/software/00289102

I updated my headset (from 1.5.0), so I'll update this thread with the results after I've used it for a week or so.

My initial impression is that the bluetooth multipoint works very well out of the box! What a relief to finally have this feature.

---

**EDIT 03/01/2023: Battery life appears to be shorter on 2.0.0 than 1.5.0 with my set that was never affected by the battery issues, however I am using multipoint. Other reviewers have reported that 1.6.1 slightly reduced battery life in an effort to limit strain on the battery.**

Some users who were affected by the battery issues and updated to 2.0.0 report longer battery life than 1.4.2, but not significantly so. Other users are reporting shorter battery life.

One user reports that 2.0.0 caused the battery drain issue to affect the opposite earbud(!?) We'll need further confirmation of this behavior.

Once again, I think it's important to emphasize that the damage to the batteries is probably already beyond the point of repair, and an RMA is your best option if you're still on 1.4.2.

--- 

**EDIT 03/01/2023 (2): Both myself and at least two are users are reporting that the battery life reported by the app changes significantly after placing the earbuds back into the case and removing them.** In one reported case, the reported battery life jumped from 1% -> 81%. In my case, with a set unaffected by the 1.4.2 battery issues, the right earbud went from 26% to 14% and left earbud from 47% to 31% after placing and removing them from the case. **This has been an issue off and on in multiple firmware versions, but it's concerning to see it return in 2.0.0.**

Despite the dramatic change in battery percentage, mine are still within a reasonable range of each other after ~6 hours of listening.

It's too early to say if this is a bigger issue, or if it will lead to the same battery issues as 1.4.2 did, but I'll make sure to keep this updated.

**I should also note, I haven't experienced any high temps while charging on 2.0.0.**

---

**EDIT 03/07/2023: While I'm still not experiencing any major issues on 2.0.0, *many* users are reporting that their battery life is FAR worse on 2.0.0 than 1.4.2.**

These are the issues I've noticed so far on 2.0.0 with my earbuds that were *unaffected* by the 1.4.2 battery life issues:

- Slightly reduced battery life versus 1.5.0
- Miscalculation of battery percentage until replaced/removed from case (present in older versions as well)
- Occasional bluetooth multipoint roaming issues that are likely caused by the audio source rather than the earbud firmware

---

**EDIT 03/23/2023: From the *many* new comments since the 2.0.0 update, the general consensus seems to be the following:**

- The 2.0.0 update doesn't introduce any *new* battery issues, however the multipoint feature will drain your battery faster if enabled.
- The 1.4.2 -> 2.0.0 upgrade path doesn't *fix* any of the battery issues on sets affected by them, and will make them substantially worse in most cases.
- RMAing your earbuds is the only *supported* option at this point. Downgrading will not fix your issues, but may result in a marginal improvement to battery life, and may prevent additional damage to the batteries.

I updated my headset (from 1.5.0), so I'll update this thread with the results after I've used it for a week or so.

My initial impression is that the bluetooth multipoint works very well out of the box! What a relief to finally have this feature.

---

**EDIT 03/01/2023: Battery life appears to be shorter on 2.0.0 than 1.5.0 with my set that was never affected by the battery issues, however I am using multipoint. Other reviewers have reported that 1.6.1 slightly reduced battery life in an effort to limit strain on the battery.**

Some users who were affected by the battery issues and updated to 2.0.0 report longer battery life than 1.4.2, but not significantly so. Other users are reporting shorter battery life.

One user reports that 2.0.0 caused the battery drain issue to affect the opposite earbud(!?) We'll need further confirmation of this behavior.

Once again, I think it's important to emphasize that the damage to the batteries is probably already beyond the point of repair, and an RMA is your best option if you're still on 1.4.2.

--- 

**EDIT 03/01/2023 (2): Both myself and at least two are users are reporting that the battery life reported by the app changes significantly after placing the earbuds back into the case and removing them.** In one reported case, the reported battery life jumped from 1% -> 81%. In my case, with a set unaffected by the 1.4.2 battery issues, the right earbud went from 26% to 14% and left earbud from 47% to 31% after placing and removing them from the case. **This has been an issue off and on in multiple firmware versions, but it's concerning to see it return in 2.0.0.**

Despite the dramatic change in battery percentage, mine are still within a reasonable range of each other after ~6 hours of listening.

It's too early to say if this is a bigger issue, or if it will lead to the same battery issues as 1.4.2 did, but I'll make sure to keep this updated.

**I should also note, I haven't experienced any high temps while charging on 2.0.0.**

---

**EDIT 03/07/2023: While I'm still not experiencing any major issues on 2.0.0, *many* users are reporting that their battery life is FAR worse on 2.0.0 than 1.4.2.**

These are the issues I've noticed so far on 2.0.0 with my earbuds that were *unaffected* by the 1.4.2 battery life issues:

- Slightly reduced battery life versus 1.5.0
- Miscalculation of battery percentage until replaced/removed from case (present in older versions as well)
- Occasional bluetooth multipoint roaming issues that are likely caused by the audio source rather than the earbud firmware

---

**EDIT 03/23/2023: From the *many* new comments since the 2.0.0 update, the general consensus seems to be the following:**

- The 2.0.0 update doesn't introduce any *new* battery issues, however the multipoint feature will drain your battery faster if enabled.
- The 1.4.2 -> 2.0.0 upgrade path doesn't *fix* any of the battery issues on sets affected by them, and will make them substantially worse in most cases.
- RMAing your earbuds is the only *supported* option at this point. Downgrading will not fix your issues, but may result in a marginal improvement to battery life, and may prevent additional damage to the batteries. Replacing your batteries at home *will* fixed the issues in all *reported* instances, but runs a risk of failure/destruction of your headset, and voids any warranty.

**To answer the most commonly-asked questions:**

- Yes, it's safe to update from 1.5.0 or 1.6.2 to 2.0.0, but it's probably unnecessary unless you want to take advantage of the multipoint functionality.
- No, it is not safe to update from 1.4.2 to 2.0.0. Don't do it.
- Unless you're unable to, RMAing your earbuds is absolutely **the best option.**

One more note -- a user just reported that you are able to use the earbuds independently of each other if you disable the Google Assistant functionality! Pretty cool. It will also be interesting to see if this reduces the *normal* uneven battery drain effect.

---

**EDIT 03/31/2023: The uneven drain (~15% after 6+ hours of usage) on 2.0.0 with multipoint enabled was completely resolved when I disabled Google Assistant.**

I have been having some frustrating multipoint roaming issues where one of my Windows 11 PCs will occasionally no longer transmit sound unless I connect/disconnect multiple times in a certain order. This happens after another Windows 11 PC is connected.

---

EDIT 04/14/2023: Recently, I began having real difficulty getting sound output when switching between devices when using multi-point. My phone's output worked 100% of the time, but multiple computers I connect to required me to disconnect and reconnect through the app (not from bluetooth settings), or put the buds back in the case, then take them out and reconnect. It's almost as if they're recognized as two devices under the same ID.

Why am I adding this seemingly-irrelevant issue to the thread? Because even wiping my settings, turning off multi-point, and doing a factory reset didn't fix the issue, so I decided to downgrade to 1.6.1.

**I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS. The 2.0.0 -> 1.6.1 downgrade path breaks the touch-sensitive buttons, causing a voice output of ""device 2 replaced"" every time they're pressed.**

Upgrading to 2.0.0 again resolved that issue, but I have yet to confirm if my sound output and bluetooth roaming issues are resolved as well.

When the supply issues eased and they transitioned to the new batteries, a firmware update optimized for the increased voltage of the new batteries permanently damaged the earbuds using the older, lower-voltage batteries. This is a pretty convincing argument considering other pieces of information we've been drip-fed over the past year.

Starting at the end of July, there have been a large number of reports of *severe* uneven battery drain in the WF-1000XM4 earbuds. The common factor appears to be the 1.4.2 update. The most concerning symptom that some users have been reporting (myself included) is that the affected earbud is now getting hotter than expected while charging in the case.

See my running list of reports here **(has not been updated since Sep 2nd, 2022 - there are now thousands of reports)**: https://pastebin.com/H20eF2x6 Each post has numerous additional reports in the comment section. If we're seeing this much activity, it's safe to assume that this is a *much* bigger problem than represented by this subset of users.

I tried to bring this to the attention of Sony, but their call center managers unsurprisingly couldn't care less about escalating what could be a *major* issue. They *will* replace them with a brand new pair under warranty, but I have yet to receive mine and test them.

I've reached out to a number of high-profile reviewers and they're tracking this issue separately and attempting to replicate it on their end.

---

EDIT 9/7/2022: Added additional reports.

---

EDIT 9/14/2022: Added lots of additional reports. New warranty-exhange earbuds arrived with firmware version 1.5.0 installed. I'll let everyone know if the issue persists.

---

EDIT 9/16/2022: My brand new pair that shipped with 1.5.0 doesn't appear to be having the same issue (yet). There's still a ~5% difference after a few hours of use, but that's probably due to the extra processing being performed in the right earbud. I'll update this after I try to drain the case/earbuds to 0%, charge, and test again.

Note: Several people have reported that the issue is *still* present on their warranty-replacement pair, so take my update with a grain of salt.

---

EDIT 9/28/2022: The new pair that shipped with 1.5.0 *still* hasn't experienced any issues with battery life or overheating. I'm curious if maybe these ones never had 1.4.2 on them, and some of the users who reported issues with their 1.5.0 pair had them upgraded from 1.4.2 in the factory.

---

EDIT 9/29/2022: Another thought - if we're all experiencing some form of overheating while charging since upgrading to 1.4.2 (whether we catch it happening or not) this could be causing permanent damage to the battery in the affected earbud. 

This might also explain why some users running 1.5.0 have reported the issue: if it was charged in-factory while running 1.4.2, overheated, and was upgraded to 1.5.0 prior to shipping, that could explain why the issue persists.

I'll be very curious to see if the issue persists with users who upgrade to 1.5.0 after it's publicly available.

---

EDIT 10/06/2022: Added at least a dozen brand new reports from Japan. My guess is that the 1.4.2 update just released there.

Sony Japan is apparently collecting a ""collection survey"" regarding the issue (translated from a Japanese tweet).

---

EDIT 10/25/2022: Lots of US customers are reporting that Sony is no longer hassling them about out-of-warranty returns and is replacing the earbuds with no questions asked.

Thanks to everyone who has contributed to this thread! If anything changes, I'll update it.

Something else I've noticed is that the left and right earbuds now connect to my devices independently. In the past, the right earbud had to be active in order for either to connect. Can anyone else confirm this behavior?

---

EDIT 11/02/2022: It looks like this downgrade tool works with the XM4 buds: https://www.mrwalkman.com/p/mdrproxyfwsidegradetool.html?m=1

Use it at your own risk. Since the battery damage is likely permanent, this may not help.

If you're stuck with a 1.4.2 set and can't exchange it, using a charger with 500ma or less may prolong its life.

---

EDIT 11/16/2022: **One user reported that downgrading resolved the issues, and another user reported that Sony Support (EU) is claiming that a firmware update will be released this month to resolve the issue.**

This gives me some hope that the vast majority of the battery issues are not permanent and replacements won't be necessary going forward. For the time being, I'd continue with the replacement process. The worst-case scenario is that you have to wait a few weeks, but end up with a brand-new pair that should have a longer lifespan.

**NOTE 03/01/2023: This has proven to be untrue. For the vast majority of users, it appears that the damage done to the battery under firmware version 1.4.2 is permanent. Earlier/later firmware versions don't *cause* the battery issues, but they don't appear to fix them either.**

---

EDIT 01/24/2023: **Sony USA appears to have established a common process for addressing these RMAs with the following list of questions:**

1. Have you tried the reset process?
2. Is the unit getting hot while charging?
3. Is the red light blinking on the unit?

Replacements are being honored outside of the standard warranty period. Additionally, some users report that they were able to get replacements without their original proof of purchase.

Something else I've noticed is that the left and right earbuds now connect to my devices independently. In the past, the right earbud had to be active in order for either to connect. Can anyone else confirm this behavior?

Use it at your own risk. Since the battery damage is likely permanent, this may not help.

If you're stuck with a 1.4.2 set and can't exchange it, using a charger with 500ma or less may prolong its life.

---

EDIT 11/16/2022: **One user reported that downgrading resolved the issues, and another user reported that Sony Support (EU) is claiming that a firmware update will be released this month to resolve the issue.**

This gives me some hope that the vast majority of the battery issues are not permanent and replacements won't be necessary going forward. For the time being, I'd continue with the replacement process. The worst-case scenario is that you have to wait a few weeks, but end up with a brand-new pair that should have a longer lifespan.

**NOTE 03/01/2023: This has proven to be untrue. For the vast majority of users, it appears that the damage done to the battery under firmware version 1.4.2 is permanent. Earlier/later firmware versions don't *cause* the battery issues, but they don't appear to fix them either.**

1. Have you tried the reset process?
2. Is the unit getting hot while charging?

Replacements are being honored outside of the standard warranty period. Additionally, some users report that they were able to get replacements without their original proof of purchase.

**EDIT 02/27/2023: Firmware version 2.0.0 has been released globally with multipoint support and a roll-up of the previous battery fixes in 1.5.0 and 1.6.1.**

https://www.sony.com/electronics/support/wireless-headphones-bluetooth-headphones/wh-1000xm4/software/00289102

I updated my headset (from 1.5.0), so I'll update this thread with the results after I've used it for a week or so.

My initial impression is that the bluetooth multipoint works very well out of the box! What a relief to finally have this feature.

---

**EDIT 03/01/2023: Battery life appears to be shorter on 2.0.0 than 1.5.0 with my set that was never affected by the battery issues, however I am using multipoint. Other reviewers have reported that 1.6.1 slightly reduced battery life in an effort to limit strain on the battery.**

Some users who were affected by the battery issues and updated to 2.0.0 report longer battery life than 1.4.2, but not significantly so. Other users are reporting shorter battery life.

One user reports that 2.0.0 caused the battery drain issue to affect the opposite earbud(!?) We'll need further confirmation of this behavior.

Once again, I think it's important to emphasize that the damage to the batteries is probably already beyond the point of repair, and an RMA is your best option if you're still on 1.4.2.

--- 

**EDIT 03/01/2023 (2): Both myself and at least two are users are reporting that the battery life reported by the app changes significantly after placing the earbuds back into the case and removing them.** In one reported case, the reported battery life jumped from 1% -> 81%. In my case, with a set unaffected by the 1.4.2 battery issues, the right earbud went from 26% to 14% and left earbud from 47% to 31% after placing and removing them from the case. **This has been an issue off and on in multiple firmware versions, but it's concerning to see it return in 2.0.0.**

Despite the dramatic change in battery percentage, mine are still within a reasonable range of each other after ~6 hours of listening.

It's too early to say if this is a bigger issue, or if it will lead to the same battery issues as 1.4.2 did, but I'll make sure to keep this updated.

**I should also note, I haven't experienced any high temps while charging on 2.0.0.**

---

**EDIT 03/07/2023: While I'm still not experiencing any major issues on 2.0.0, *many* users are reporting that their battery life is FAR worse on 2.0.0 than 1.4.2.**

These are the issues I've noticed so far on 2.0.0 with my earbuds that were *unaffected* by the 1.4.2 battery life issues:

- Slightly reduced battery life versus 1.5.0
- Miscalculation of battery percentage until replaced/removed from case (present in older versions as well)
- Occasional bluetooth multipoint roaming issues that are likely caused by the audio source rather than the earbud firmware

---

**EDIT 03/23/2023: From the *many* new comments since the 2.0.0 update, the general consensus seems to be the following:**

- The 2.0.0 update doesn't introduce any *new* battery issues, however the multipoint feature will drain your battery faster if enabled.
- The 1.4.2 -> 2.0.0 upgrade path doesn't *fix* any of the battery issues on sets affected by them, and will make them substantially worse in most cases.
- RMAing your earbuds is the only *supported* option at this point. Downgrading will not fix your issues, but may result in a marginal improvement to battery life, and may prevent additional damage to the batteries. Replacing your batteries at home *will* fixed the issues in all *reported* instances, but runs a risk of failure/destruction of your headset, and voids any warranty.

**To answer the most commonly-asked questions:**

- Yes, it's safe to update from 1.5.0 or 1.6.2 to 2.0.0, but it's probably unnecessary unless you want to take advantage of the multipoint functionality.
- No, it is not safe to update from 1.4.2 to 2.0.0. Don't do it.
- Unless you're unable to, RMAing your earbuds is absolutely **the best option.**

One more note -- a user just reported that you are able to use the earbuds independently of each other if you disable the Google Assistant functionality! Pretty cool. It will also be interesting to see if this reduces the *normal* uneven battery drain effect.

---

**EDIT 03/31/2023: The uneven drain (~15% after 6+ hours of usage) on 2.0.0 with multipoint enabled was completely resolved when I disabled Google Assistant.**

I have been having some frustrating multipoint roaming issues where one of my Windows 11 PCs will occasionally no longer transmit sound unless I connect/disconnect multiple times in a certain order. This happens after another Windows 11 PC is connected.

---

EDIT 04/14/2023: Recently, I began having real difficulty getting sound output when switching between devices when using multi-point. My phone's output worked 100% of the time, but multiple computers I connect to required me to disconnect and reconnect through the app (not from bluetooth settings), or put the buds back in the case, then take them out and reconnect. It's almost as if they're recognized as two devices under the same ID.

Why am I adding this seemingly-irrelevant issue to the thread? Because even wiping my settings, turning off multi-point, and doing a factory reset didn't fix the issue, so I decided to downgrade to 1.6.1.

**I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS. The 2.0.0 -> 1.6.1 downgrade path breaks the touch-sensitive buttons, causing a voice output of ""device 2 replaced"" every time they're pressed.**

Upgrading to 2.0.0 again resolved that issue, but I have yet to confirm if my sound output and bluetooth roaming issues are resolved as well.

Essentially, Sony *may* have had a supply issue with the new model of batteries they wanted to use in the XM4 and ended up using the same batteries as the XM3. When the supply issues eased and they transitioned to the new batteries, a firmware update optimized for the increased voltage of the new batteries permanently damaged the earbuds using the older, lower-voltage batteries. This is a pretty convincing argument considering other pieces of information we've been drip-fed over the past year.

---

Starting at the end of July, there have been a large number of reports of *severe* uneven battery drain in the WF-1000XM4 earbuds. The common factor appears to be the 1.4.2 update. The most concerning symptom that some users have been reporting (myself included) is that the affected earbud is now getting hotter than expected while charging in the case.

See my running list of reports here **(has not been updated since Sep 2nd, 2022 - there are now thousands of reports)**: https://pastebin.com/H20eF2x6 Each post has numerous additional reports in the comment section. If we're seeing this much activity, it's safe to assume that this is a *much* bigger problem than represented by this subset of users.

I tried to bring this to the attention of Sony, but their call center managers unsurprisingly couldn't care less about escalating what could be a *major* issue. They *will* replace them with a brand new pair under warranty, but I have yet to receive mine and test them.

I've reached out to a number of high-profile reviewers and they're tracking this issue separately and attempting to replicate it on their end.

---

EDIT 9/7/2022: Added additional reports.

---

EDIT 9/14/2022: Added lots of additional reports. New warranty-exhange earbuds arrived with firmware version 1.5.0 installed. I'll let everyone know if the issue persists.

---

EDIT 9/16/2022: My brand new pair that shipped with 1.5.0 doesn't appear to be having the same issue (yet). There's still a ~5% difference after a few hours of use, but that's probably due to the extra processing being performed in the right earbud. I'll update this after I try to drain the case/earbuds to 0%, charge, and test again.

Note: Several people have reported that the issue is *still* present on their warranty-replacement pair, so take my update with a grain of salt.

---

EDIT 9/28/2022: The new pair that shipped with 1.5.0 *still* hasn't experienced any issues with battery life or overheating. I'm curious if maybe these ones never had 1.4.2 on them, and some of the users who reported issues with their 1.5.0 pair had them upgraded from 1.4.2 in the factory.

---

EDIT 9/29/2022: Another thought - if we're all experiencing some form of overheating while charging since upgrading to 1.4.2 (whether we catch it happening or not) this could be causing permanent damage to the battery in the affected earbud. 

This might also explain why some users running 1.5.0 have reported the issue: if it was charged in-factory while running 1.4.2, overheated, and was upgraded to 1.5.0 prior to shipping, that could explain why the issue persists.

I'll be very curious to see if the issue persists with users who upgrade to 1.5.0 after it's publicly available.

---

EDIT 10/06/2022: Added at least a dozen brand new reports from Japan. My guess is that the 1.4.2 update just released there.

Sony Japan is apparently collecting a ""collection survey"" regarding the issue (translated from a Japanese tweet).

There's still a ~5% difference after a few hours of use, but that's probably due to the extra processing being performed in the right earbud. I'll update this after I try to drain the case/earbuds to 0%, charge, and test again.

Note: Several people have reported that the issue is *still* present on their warranty-replacement pair, so take my update with a grain of salt.

---

EDIT 9/28/2022: The new pair that shipped with 1.5.0 *still* hasn't experienced any issues with battery life or overheating. I'm curious if maybe these ones never had 1.4.2 on them, and some of the users who reported issues with their 1.5.0 pair had them upgraded from 1.4.2 in the factory.

---

EDIT 9/29/2022: Another thought - if we're all experiencing some form of overheating while charging since upgrading to 1.4.2 (whether we catch it happening or not) this could be causing permanent damage to the battery in the affected earbud. 

This might also explain why some users running 1.5.0 have reported the issue: if it was charged in-factory while running 1.4.2, overheated, and was upgraded to 1.5.0 prior to shipping, that could explain why the issue persists.

I'll be very curious to see if the issue persists with users who upgrade to 1.5.0 after it's publicly available.

---

EDIT 10/06/2022: Added at least a dozen brand new reports from Japan. My guess is that the 1.4.2 update just released there.

Sony Japan is apparently collecting a ""collection survey"" regarding the issue (translated from a Japanese tweet).

Thanks to everyone who has contributed to this thread! If anything changes, I'll update it.

Something else I've noticed is that the left and right earbuds now connect to my devices independently. In the past, the right earbud had to be active in order for either to connect. Can anyone else confirm this behavior?

EDIT 11/02/2022: It looks like this downgrade tool works with the XM4 buds: https://www.mrwalkman.com/p/mdrproxyfwsidegradetool.html?m=1

Use it at your own risk. Since the battery damage is likely permanent, this may not help.

If you're stuck with a 1.4.2 set and can't exchange it, using a charger with 500ma or less may prolong its life.

---

EDIT 11/16/2022: **One user reported that downgrading resolved the issues, and another user reported that Sony Support (EU) is claiming that a firmware update will be released this month to resolve the issue.**

This gives me some hope that the vast majority of the battery issues are not permanent and replacements won't be necessary going forward. For the time being, I'd continue with the replacement process. The worst-case scenario is that you have to wait a few weeks, but end up with a brand-new pair that should have a longer lifespan.

**NOTE 03/01/2023: This has proven to be untrue. For the vast majority of users, it appears that the damage done to the battery under firmware version 1.4.2 is permanent. Earlier/later firmware versions don't *cause* the battery issues, but they don't appear to fix them either.**

---

EDIT 01/24/2023: **Sony USA appears to have established a common process for addressing these RMAs with the following list of questions:**

1. Have you tried the reset process?
2. Is the unit getting hot while charging?
3. Is the red light blinking on the unit?

I updated my headset (from 1.5.0), so I'll update this thread with the results after I've used it for a week or so.

My initial impression is that the bluetooth multipoint works very well out of the box! What a relief to finally have this feature.

---

**EDIT 03/01/2023: Battery life appears to be shorter on 2.0.0 than 1.5.0 with my set that was never affected by the battery issues, however I am using multipoint. Other reviewers have reported that 1.6.1 slightly reduced battery life in an effort to limit strain on the battery.**

Some users who were affected by the battery issues and updated to 2.0.0 report longer battery life than 1.4.2, but not significantly so. Other users are reporting shorter battery life.

One user reports that 2.0.0 caused the battery drain issue to affect the opposite earbud(!?) We'll need further confirmation of this behavior.

Once again, I think it's important to emphasize that the damage to the batteries is probably already beyond the point of repair, and an RMA is your best option if you're still on 1.4.2.

--- 

**EDIT 03/01/2023 (2): Both myself and at least two are users are reporting that the battery life reported by the app changes significantly after placing the earbuds back into the case and removing them.** In one reported case, the reported battery life jumped from 1% -> 81%. In my case, with a set unaffected by the 1.4.2 battery issues, the right earbud went from 26% to 14% and left earbud from 47% to 31% after placing and removing them from the case. **This has been an issue off and on in multiple firmware versions, but it's concerning to see it return in 2.0.0.**

Despite the dramatic change in battery percentage, mine are still within a reasonable range of each other after ~6 hours of listening.

It's too early to say if this is a bigger issue, or if it will lead to the same battery issues as 1.4.2 did, but I'll make sure to keep this updated.

**I should also note, I haven't experienced any high temps while charging on 2.0.0.**

---

**EDIT 03/07/2023: While I'm still not experiencing any major issues on 2.0.0, *many* users are reporting that their battery life is FAR worse on 2.0.0 than 1.4.2.**

These are the issues I've noticed so far on 2.0.0 with my earbuds that were *unaffected* by the 1.4.2 battery life issues:

- Slightly reduced battery life versus 1.5.0
- Miscalculation of battery percentage until replaced/removed from case (present in older versions as well)
- Occasional bluetooth multipoint roaming issues that are likely caused by the audio source rather than the earbud firmware

---

**EDIT 03/23/2023: From the *many* new comments since the 2.0.0 update, the general consensus seems to be the following:**

- The 2.0.0 update doesn't introduce any *new* battery issues, however the multipoint feature will drain your battery faster if enabled.
- The 1.4.2 -> 2.0.0 upgrade path doesn't *fix* any of the battery issues on sets affected by them, and will make them substantially worse in most cases.
- RMAing your earbuds is the only *supported* option at this point. Downgrading will not fix your issues, but may result in a marginal improvement to battery life, and may prevent additional damage to the batteries. Replacing your batteries at home *will* fixed the issues in all *reported* instances, but runs a risk of failure/destruction of your headset, and voids any warranty.

**To answer the most commonly-asked questions:**

- Yes, it's safe to update from 1.5.0 or 1.6.2 to 2.0.0, but it's probably unnecessary unless you want to take advantage of the multipoint functionality.
- No, it is not safe to update from 1.4.2 to 2.0.0. Don't do it.
- Unless you're unable to, RMAing your earbuds is absolutely **the best option.**

One more note -- a user just reported that you are able to use the earbuds independently of each other if you disable the Google Assistant functionality! Pretty cool. It will also be interesting to see if this reduces the *normal* uneven battery drain effect.

---

**EDIT 03/31/2023: The uneven drain (~15% after 6+ hours of usage) on 2.0.0 with multipoint enabled was completely resolved when I disabled Google Assistant.**

I have been having some frustrating multipoint roaming issues where one of my Windows 11 PCs will occasionally no longer transmit sound unless I connect/disconnect multiple times in a certain order. This happens after another Windows 11 PC is connected.

---

EDIT 04/14/2023: Recently, I began having real difficulty getting sound output when switching between devices when using multi-point. My phone's output worked 100% of the time, but multiple computers I connect to required me to disconnect and reconnect through the app (not from bluetooth settings), or put the buds back in the case, then take them out and reconnect. It's almost as if they're recognized as two devices under the same ID.

Why am I adding this seemingly-irrelevant issue to the thread? Because even wiping my settings, turning off multi-point, and doing a factory reset didn't fix the issue, so I decided to downgrade to 1.6.1.

**I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS. The 2.0.0 -> 1.6.1 downgrade path breaks the touch-sensitive buttons, causing a voice output of ""device 2 replaced"" every time they're pressed.**

This is a pretty convincing argument considering other pieces of information we've been drip-fed over the past year.

SonyHeadphones,WF-1000XM4 - Severe Battery Issues,"**PLEASE READ THE LATEST UPDATES AT THE BOTTOM OF THE THREAD. UPDATED NOV 3rd 2023.**

---

Starting at the end of July, there have been a large number of reports of *severe* uneven battery drain in the WF-1000XM4 earbuds. The common factor appears to be the 1.4.2 update. The most concerning symptom that some users have been reporting (myself included) is that the affected earbud is now getting hotter than expected while charging in the case.

See my running list of reports here **(has not been updated since Sep 2nd, 2022 - there are now thousands of reports)**: https://pastebin.com/H20eF2x6 Each post has numerous additional reports in the comment section. If we're seeing this much activity, it's safe to assume that this is a *much* bigger problem than represented by this subset of users.

I tried to bring this to the attention of Sony, but their call center managers unsurprisingly couldn't care less about escalating what could be a *major* issue. They *will* replace them with a brand new pair under warranty, but I have yet to receive mine and test them.

I've reached out to a number of high-profile reviewers and they're tracking this issue separately and attempting to replicate it on their end.

---

EDIT 9/7/2022: Added additional reports.

---

EDIT 9/14/2022: Added lots of additional reports. New warranty-exhange earbuds arrived with firmware version 1.5.0 installed. I'll let everyone know if the issue persists.

---

EDIT 9/16/2022: My brand new pair that shipped with 1.5.0 doesn't appear to be having the same issue (yet). There's still a ~5% difference after a few hours of use, but that's probably due to the extra processing being performed in the right earbud. I'll update this after I try to drain the case/earbuds to 0%, charge, and test again.

Note: Several people have reported that the issue is *still* present on their warranty-replacement pair, so take my update with a grain of salt.

SonyHeadphones,WF-1000XM4 - Severe Battery Issues,"**PLEASE READ THE LATEST UPDATES AT THE BOTTOM OF THE THREAD. UPDATED NOV 3rd 2023.**

---

Starting at the end of July, there have been a large number of reports of *severe* uneven battery drain in the WF-1000XM4 earbuds. The common factor appears to be the 1.4.2 update. The most concerning symptom that some users have been reporting (myself included) is that the affected earbud is now getting hotter than expected while charging in the case.

See my running list of reports here **(has not been updated since Sep 2nd, 2022 - there are now thousands of reports)**: https://pastebin.com/H20eF2x6 Each post has numerous additional reports in the comment section. If we're seeing this much activity, it's safe to assume that this is a *much* bigger problem than represented by this subset of users.

I tried to bring this to the attention of Sony, but their call center managers unsurprisingly couldn't care less about escalating what could be a *major* issue. They *will* replace them with a brand new pair under warranty, but I have yet to receive mine and test them.

I've reached out to a number of high-profile reviewers and they're tracking this issue separately and attempting to replicate it on their end.

---

EDIT 9/7/2022: Added additional reports.

---

EDIT 9/14/2022: Added lots of additional reports. New warranty-exhange earbuds arrived with firmware version 1.5.0 installed. I'll let everyone know if the issue persists.

---

EDIT 9/16/2022: My brand new pair that shipped with 1.5.0 doesn't appear to be having the same issue (yet). There's still a ~5% difference after a few hours of use, but that's probably due to the extra processing being performed in the right earbud. I'll update this after I try to drain the case/earbuds to 0%, charge, and test again.

Note: Several people have reported that the issue is *still* present on their warranty-replacement pair, so take my update with a grain of salt.

---

EDIT 9/28/2022: The new pair that shipped with 1.5.0 *still* hasn't experienced any issues with battery life or overheating. I'm curious if maybe these ones never had 1.4.2 on them, and some of the users who reported issues with their 1.5.0 pair had them upgraded from 1.4.2 in the factory.

---

EDIT 9/29/2022: Another thought - if we're all experiencing some form of overheating while charging since upgrading to 1.4.2 (whether we catch it happening or not) this could be causing permanent damage to the battery in the affected earbud. 

This might also explain why some users running 1.5.0 have reported the issue: if it was charged in-factory while running 1.4.2, overheated, and was upgraded to 1.5.0 prior to shipping, that could explain why the issue persists.

I'll be very curious to see if the issue persists with users who upgrade to 1.5.0 after it's publicly available.

---

EDIT 10/06/2022: Added at least a dozen brand new reports from Japan. My guess is that the 1.4.2 update just released there.

Sony Japan is apparently collecting a ""collection survey"" regarding the issue (translated from a Japanese tweet).

Here's the official report: https://i.imgur.com/WANV64y.jpg

**Here's our first battery expansion report -- in other words, this is REALLY bad for Sony: https://twitter.com/cardamon00/status/1577596298005741575**

---

EDIT 10/25/2022: Lots of US customers are reporting that Sony is no longer hassling them about out-of-warranty returns and is replacing the earbuds with no questions asked.

Thanks to everyone who has contributed to this thread! If anything changes, I'll update it.

Something else I've noticed is that the left and right earbuds now connect to my devices independently. In the past, the right earbud had to be active in order for either to connect. Can anyone else confirm this behavior?

---

EDIT 11/02/2022: It looks like this downgrade tool works with the XM4 buds: https://www.mrwalkman.com/p/mdrproxyfwsidegradetool.html?m=1

Use it at your own risk. Since the battery damage is likely permanent, this may not help.

If you're stuck with a 1.4.2 set and can't exchange it, using a charger with 500ma or less may prolong its life.

---

EDIT 11/16/2022: **One user reported that downgrading resolved the issues, and another user reported that Sony Support (EU) is claiming that a firmware update will be released this month to resolve the issue.**

This gives me some hope that the vast majority of the battery issues are not permanent and replacements won't be necessary going forward. For the time being, I'd continue with the replacement process. The worst-case scenario is that you have to wait a few weeks, but end up with a brand-new pair that should have a longer lifespan.

**NOTE 03/01/2023: This has proven to be untrue. For the vast majority of users, it appears that the damage done to the battery under firmware version 1.4.2 is permanent. Earlier/later firmware versions don't *cause* the battery issues, but they don't appear to fix them either.**

---

EDIT 01/24/2023: **Sony USA appears to have established a common process for addressing these RMAs with the following list of questions:**

1. Have you tried the reset process?
2. Is the unit getting hot while charging?
3. Is the red light blinking on the unit?

Replacements are being honored outside of the standard warranty period. Additionally, some users report that they were able to get replacements without their original proof of purchase.

---

EDIT 02/23/2023: One user reports that connecting to a VPN node in Japan allowed them to update to 1.6.1. The prompt appeared automatically shortly after connecting and opening the app.

**As predicted in my 10/06/2022 edit, we finally have our first report of an ""exploding"" earbud.

---

**EDIT 02/27/2023: Firmware version 2.0.0 has been released globally with multipoint support and a roll-up of the previous battery fixes in 1.5.0 and 1.6.1.**

https://www.sony.com/electronics/support/wireless-headphones-bluetooth-headphones/wh-1000xm4/software/00289102

I updated my headset (from 1.5.0), so I'll update this thread with the results after I've used it for a week or so.

My initial impression is that the bluetooth multipoint works very well out of the box! What a relief to finally have this feature.

---

**EDIT 03/01/2023: Battery life appears to be shorter on 2.0.0 than 1.5.0 with my set that was never affected by the battery issues, however I am using multipoint. Other reviewers have reported that 1.6.1 slightly reduced battery life in an effort to limit strain on the battery.**

Some users who were affected by the battery issues and updated to 2.0.0 report longer battery life than 1.4.2, but not significantly so. Other users are reporting shorter battery life.

One user reports that 2.0.0 caused the battery drain issue to affect the opposite earbud(!?) We'll need further confirmation of this behavior.

Once again, I think it's important to emphasize that the damage to the batteries is probably already beyond the point of repair, and an RMA is your best option if you're still on 1.4.2.

--- 

**EDIT 03/01/2023 (2): Both myself and at least two are users are reporting that the battery life reported by the app changes significantly after placing the earbuds back into the case and removing them.** In one reported case, the reported battery life jumped from 1% -> 81%. In my case, with a set unaffected by the 1.4.2 battery issues, the right earbud went from 26% to 14% and left earbud from 47% to 31% after placing and removing them from the case. **This has been an issue off and on in multiple firmware versions, but it's concerning to see it return in 2.0.0.**

Despite the dramatic change in battery percentage, mine are still within a reasonable range of each other after ~6 hours of listening.

It's too early to say if this is a bigger issue, or if it will lead to the same battery issues as 1.4.2 did, but I'll make sure to keep this updated.

**I should also note, I haven't experienced any high temps while charging on 2.0.0.**

---

**EDIT 03/07/2023: While I'm still not experiencing any major issues on 2.0.0, *many* users are reporting that their battery life is FAR worse on 2.0.0 than 1.4.2.**

These are the issues I've noticed so far on 2.0.0 with my earbuds that were *unaffected* by the 1.4.2 battery life issues:

- Slightly reduced battery life versus 1.5.0
- Miscalculation of battery percentage until replaced/removed from case (present in older versions as well)
- Occasional bluetooth multipoint roaming issues that are likely caused by the audio source rather than the earbud firmware

---

**EDIT 03/23/2023: From the *many* new comments since the 2.0.0 update, the general consensus seems to be the following:**

- The 2.0.0 update doesn't introduce any *new* battery issues, however the multipoint feature will drain your battery faster if enabled.
- The 1.4.2 -> 2.0.0 upgrade path doesn't *fix* any of the battery issues on sets affected by them, and will make them substantially worse in most cases.
- RMAing your earbuds is the only *supported* option at this point. Downgrading will not fix your issues, but may result in a marginal improvement to battery life, and may prevent additional damage to the batteries. Replacing your batteries at home *will* fixed the issues in all *reported* instances, but runs a risk of failure/destruction of your headset, and voids any warranty.

**To answer the most commonly-asked questions:**

- Yes, it's safe to update from 1.5.0 or 1.6.2 to 2.0.0, but it's probably unnecessary unless you want to take advantage of the multipoint functionality.
- No, it is not safe to update from 1.4.2 to 2.0.0. Don't do it.
- Unless you're unable to, RMAing your earbuds is absolutely **the best option.**

One more note -- a user just reported that you are able to use the earbuds independently of each other if you disable the Google Assistant functionality! Pretty cool. It will also be interesting to see if this reduces the *normal* uneven battery drain effect.

---

**EDIT 03/31/2023: The uneven drain (~15% after 6+ hours of usage) on 2.0.0 with multipoint enabled was completely resolved when I disabled Google Assistant.**

I have been having some frustrating multipoint roaming issues where one of my Windows 11 PCs will occasionally no longer transmit sound unless I connect/disconnect multiple times in a certain order. This happens after another Windows 11 PC is connected.

---

EDIT 04/14/2023: Recently, I began having real difficulty getting sound output when switching between devices when using multi-point. My phone's output worked 100% of the time, but multiple computers I connect to required me to disconnect and reconnect through the app (not from bluetooth settings), or put the buds back in the case, then take them out and reconnect. It's almost as if they're recognized as two devices under the same ID.

Why am I adding this seemingly-irrelevant issue to the thread? Because even wiping my settings, turning off multi-point, and doing a factory reset didn't fix the issue, so I decided to downgrade to 1.6.1.

**I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS. The 2.0.0 -> 1.6.1 downgrade path breaks the touch-sensitive buttons, causing a voice output of ""device 2 replaced"" every time they're pressed.**

Upgrading to 2.0.0 again resolved that issue, but I have yet to confirm if my sound output and bluetooth roaming issues are resolved as well.

---

EDIT 04/20/2023: A user reported that you can resolve the touch-button issue on the 2.0.0 -> 1.6.1 downgrade path by reinstalling the English language package.

Another user reported that changing the language in the headphones app under Notification & Voice Guide to another language and then back to English fixed it.

Essentially, Sony *may* have had a supply issue with the new model of batteries they wanted to use in the XM4 and ended up using the same batteries as the XM3. When the supply issues eased and they transitioned to the new batteries, a firmware update optimized for the increased voltage of the new batteries permanently damaged the earbuds using the older, lower-voltage batteries. This is a pretty convincing argument considering other pieces of information we've been drip-fed over the past year.

**UPDATE 9/14/2023: This theory has been pretty thoroughly refuted by new evidence.**

---

**EDIT 09/06/2023:** For those still interested in an RCA for the issue, one Reddit user reports that the explanation in the previous edit doesn't align with their experience. In their case, the battery issue was occurring despite their unit having the newer model of batteries: 

> Just replaced battery manually following youtube guides. I don't think the old model of battery is the problem because in my case the old battery which was causing the problem is the same model (Z55H) as the new one.

In another thread a Reddit user reported that Sony exchanged an RMA'd pair of XM4s for a new set of XM5s. Nice!

---

**EDIT 10/30/2023:** In the USA there's currently a 3-month backorder on WF-1000XM4 replacement sets. Sony is currently offering refunds to (presumably) *all* customers with a valid receipt.

---

**EDIT 11/03/2023:** I originally removed this from the post because I believed it to be speculation, but I've seen quite a few reports that there are similar battery issues affecting the WF-1000XM5s. In fact, one user reports that they've gone through multiple RMAs *and* that they have friends who've encountered the same issues on their XM5s.

To add to the frustration, it seems that the offer that Sony USA is giving XM4 RMA requesters (refunds or upgrades to the XM5) isn't being honored worldwide. A few users have even said that Sony isn't acknowledging *any* issues in certain countries.

--- 

**EDIT 02/14/2024:** One user reports that United Repairs has the parts for the XM4s back in stock, so they're repairing rather than replacing them.

---

Starting at the end of July, there have been a large number of reports of *severe* uneven battery drain in the WF-1000XM4 earbuds. The common factor appears to be the 1.4.2 update. The most concerning symptom that some users have been reporting (myself included) is that the affected earbud is now getting hotter than expected while charging in the case.

See my running list of reports here **(has not been updated since Sep 2nd, 2022 - there are now thousands of reports)**: https://pastebin.com/H20eF2x6 Each post has numerous additional reports in the comment section. If we're seeing this much activity, it's safe to assume that this is a *much* bigger problem than represented by this subset of users.

I tried to bring this to the attention of Sony, but their call center managers unsurprisingly couldn't care less about escalating what could be a *major* issue. They *will* replace them with a brand new pair under warranty, but I have yet to receive mine and test them.

I've reached out to a number of high-profile reviewers and they're tracking this issue separately and attempting to replicate it on their end.

---

EDIT 9/7/2022: Added additional reports.

---

EDIT 9/14/2022: Added lots of additional reports. New warranty-exhange earbuds arrived with firmware version 1.5.0 installed. I'll let everyone know if the issue persists.

---

EDIT 9/16/2022: My brand new pair that shipped with 1.5.0 doesn't appear to be having the same issue (yet). There's still a ~5% difference after a few hours of use, but that's probably due to the extra processing being performed in the right earbud. I'll update this after I try to drain the case/earbuds to 0%, charge, and test again.

Note: Several people have reported that the issue is *still* present on their warranty-replacement pair, so take my update with a grain of salt.

---

EDIT 9/28/2022: The new pair that shipped with 1.5.0 *still* hasn't experienced any issues with battery life or overheating. I'm curious if maybe these ones never had 1.4.2 on them, and some of the users who reported issues with their 1.5.0 pair had them upgraded from 1.4.2 in the factory.

---

EDIT 9/29/2022: Another thought - if we're all experiencing some form of overheating while charging since upgrading to 1.4.2 (whether we catch it happening or not) this could be causing permanent damage to the battery in the affected earbud. 

This might also explain why some users running 1.5.0 have reported the issue: if it was charged in-factory while running 1.4.2, overheated, and was upgraded to 1.5.0 prior to shipping, that could explain why the issue persists.

I'll be very curious to see if the issue persists with users who upgrade to 1.5.0 after it's publicly available.

---

EDIT 10/06/2022: Added at least a dozen brand new reports from Japan. My guess is that the 1.4.2 update just released there.

Sony Japan is apparently collecting a ""collection survey"" regarding the issue (translated from a Japanese tweet).

Here's the official report: https://i.imgur.com/WANV64y.jpg

**Here's our first battery expansion report -- in other words, this is REALLY bad for Sony: https://twitter.com/cardamon00/status/1577596298005741575**

---

EDIT 10/25/2022: Lots of US customers are reporting that Sony is no longer hassling them about out-of-warranty returns and is replacing the earbuds with no questions asked.

Thanks to everyone who has contributed to this thread! If anything changes, I'll update it.

Something else I've noticed is that the left and right earbuds now connect to my devices independently. In the past, the right earbud had to be active in order for either to connect. Can anyone else confirm this behavior?

---

EDIT 11/02/2022: It looks like this downgrade tool works with the XM4 buds: https://www.mrwalkman.com/p/mdrproxyfwsidegradetool.html?m=1

Use it at your own risk. Since the battery damage is likely permanent, this may not help.

If you're stuck with a 1.4.2 set and can't exchange it, using a charger with 500ma or less may prolong its life.

---

EDIT 11/16/2022: **One user reported that downgrading resolved the issues, and another user reported that Sony Support (EU) is claiming that a firmware update will be released this month to resolve the issue.**

This gives me some hope that the vast majority of the battery issues are not permanent and replacements won't be necessary going forward. For the time being, I'd continue with the replacement process. The worst-case scenario is that you have to wait a few weeks, but end up with a brand-new pair that should have a longer lifespan.

**NOTE 03/01/2023: This has proven to be untrue. For the vast majority of users, it appears that the damage done to the battery under firmware version 1.4.2 is permanent. Earlier/later firmware versions don't *cause* the battery issues, but they don't appear to fix them either.**

---

EDIT 01/24/2023: **Sony USA appears to have established a common process for addressing these RMAs with the following list of questions:**

1. Have you tried the reset process?
2. Is the unit getting hot while charging?
3. Is the red light blinking on the unit?

Replacements are being honored outside of the standard warranty period. Additionally, some users report that they were able to get replacements without their original proof of purchase.

---

EDIT 02/23/2023: One user reports that connecting to a VPN node in Japan allowed them to update to 1.6.1. The prompt appeared automatically shortly after connecting and opening the app.

**As predicted in my 10/06/2022 edit, we finally have our first report of an ""exploding"" earbud.

---

**EDIT 02/27/2023: Firmware version 2.0.0 has been released globally with multipoint support and a roll-up of the previous battery fixes in 1.5.0 and 1.6.1.**

https://www.sony.com/electronics/support/wireless-headphones-bluetooth-headphones/wh-1000xm4/software/00289102

I updated my headset (from 1.5.0), so I'll update this thread with the results after I've used it for a week or so.

My initial impression is that the bluetooth multipoint works very well out of the box! What a relief to finally have this feature.

---

**EDIT 03/01/2023: Battery life appears to be shorter on 2.0.0 than 1.5.0 with my set that was never affected by the battery issues, however I am using multipoint. Other reviewers have reported that 1.6.1 slightly reduced battery life in an effort to limit strain on the battery.**

Some users who were affected by the battery issues and updated to 2.0.0 report longer battery life than 1.4.2, but not significantly so. Other users are reporting shorter battery life.

One user reports that 2.0.0 caused the battery drain issue to affect the opposite earbud(!?) We'll need further confirmation of this behavior.

Once again, I think it's important to emphasize that the damage to the batteries is probably already beyond the point of repair, and an RMA is your best option if you're still on 1.4.2.

--- 

**EDIT 03/01/2023 (2): Both myself and at least two are users are reporting that the battery life reported by the app changes significantly after placing the earbuds back into the case and removing them.** In one reported case, the reported battery life jumped from 1% -> 81%. In my case, with a set unaffected by the 1.4.2 battery issues, the right earbud went from 26% to 14% and left earbud from 47% to 31% after placing and removing them from the case. **This has been an issue off and on in multiple firmware versions, but it's concerning to see it return in 2.0.0.**

Despite the dramatic change in battery percentage, mine are still within a reasonable range of each other after ~6 hours of listening.

It's too early to say if this is a bigger issue, or if it will lead to the same battery issues as 1.4.2 did, but I'll make sure to keep this updated.

**I should also note, I haven't experienced any high temps while charging on 2.0.0.**

---

**EDIT 03/07/2023: While I'm still not experiencing any major issues on 2.0.0, *many* users are reporting that their battery life is FAR worse on 2.0.0 than 1.4.2.**

These are the issues I've noticed so far on 2.0.0 with my earbuds that were *unaffected* by the 1.4.2 battery life issues:

- Slightly reduced battery life versus 1.5.0
- Miscalculation of battery percentage until replaced/removed from case (present in older versions as well)
- Occasional bluetooth multipoint roaming issues that are likely caused by the audio source rather than the earbud firmware

---

**EDIT 03/23/2023: From the *many* new comments since the 2.0.0 update, the general consensus seems to be the following:**

- The 2.0.0 update doesn't introduce any *new* battery issues, however the multipoint feature will drain your battery faster if enabled.
- The 1.4.2 -> 2.0.0 upgrade path doesn't *fix* any of the battery issues on sets affected by them, and will make them substantially worse in most cases.
- RMAing your earbuds is the only *supported* option at this point. Downgrading will not fix your issues, but may result in a marginal improvement to battery life, and may prevent additional damage to the batteries. Replacing your batteries at home *will* fixed the issues in all *reported* instances, but runs a risk of failure/destruction of your headset, and voids any warranty.

**To answer the most commonly-asked questions:**

- Yes, it's safe to update from 1.5.0 or 1.6.2 to 2.0.0, but it's probably unnecessary unless you want to take advantage of the multipoint functionality.
- No, it is not safe to update from 1.4.2 to 2.0.0. Don't do it.
- Unless you're unable to, RMAing your earbuds is absolutely **the best option.**

One more note -- a user just reported that you are able to use the earbuds independently of each other if you disable the Google Assistant functionality! Pretty cool. It will also be interesting to see if this reduces the *normal* uneven battery drain effect.

---

**EDIT 03/31/2023: The uneven drain (~15% after 6+ hours of usage) on 2.0.0 with multipoint enabled was completely resolved when I disabled Google Assistant.**

I have been having some frustrating multipoint roaming issues where one of my Windows 11 PCs will occasionally no longer transmit sound unless I connect/disconnect multiple times in a certain order. This happens after another Windows 11 PC is connected.

---

EDIT 04/14/2023: Recently, I began having real difficulty getting sound output when switching between devices when using multi-point. My phone's output worked 100% of the time, but multiple computers I connect to required me to disconnect and reconnect through the app (not from bluetooth settings), or put the buds back in the case, then take them out and reconnect. It's almost as if they're recognized as two devices under the same ID.

Why am I adding this seemingly-irrelevant issue to the thread? Because even wiping my settings, turning off multi-point, and doing a factory reset didn't fix the issue, so I decided to downgrade to 1.6.1.

**I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS. The 2.0.0 -> 1.6.1 downgrade path breaks the touch-sensitive buttons, causing a voice output of ""device 2 replaced"" every time they're pressed.**

Upgrading to 2.0.0 again resolved that issue, but I have yet to confirm if my sound output and bluetooth roaming issues are resolved as well.

---

EDIT 04/20/2023: A user reported that you can resolve the touch-button issue on the 2.0.0 -> 1.6.1 downgrade path by reinstalling the English language package.

Another user reported that changing the language in the headphones app under Notification & Voice Guide to another language and then back to English fixed it.

---

EDIT 04/25/2023: Another battery expansion report by a fellow Redditor: https://www.reddit.com/r/SonyHeadphones/comments/12yuf7o/my_wf_xm4s_finally_bit_it/

---

EDIT 05/01/2023: One user reported that a Sony rep. let it slip that both the batteries in the original run *and* the 1.4.2 software update are to blame for the issues.

---

**EDIT 07/31/2023:** Here's an **iFixIt guide on how to replace the batteries** yourself: https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Sony+WF-1000XM4+Wireless+Earbuds+battery+replacement/162365

Furthermore, another user has provided some interesting speculation as to what the root cause might be in the comment section of this Verge post:
https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/25/23806918/sony-wf-1000xm5-earbuds-battery-drain-statement?commentID=ecfcbde9-5843-4b61-8c87-21f3c6c0e9a6


Essentially, Sony *may* have had a supply issue with the new model of batteries they wanted to use in the XM4 and ended up using the same batteries as the XM3. When the supply issues eased and they transitioned to the new batteries, a firmware update optimized for the increased voltage of the new batteries permanently damaged the earbuds using the older, lower-voltage batteries. This is a pretty convincing argument considering other pieces of information we've been drip-fed over the past year.

My left earbud (the one that was affected) fully drains in less than 20 minutes; the fastest it drained was in 3 minutes. I never experienced the overheating issue.

The weird thing is that, after it's drained, I can pop it back into the charging case for 10–20 seconds. After taking them back out, the Sony Headphones app detects that the battery is significantly higher than before. One time I did this, the battery jumped from 1% to 81%.

Why am I adding this seemingly-irrelevant issue to the thread? Because even wiping my settings, turning off multi-point, and doing a factory reset didn't fix the issue, so I decided to downgrade to 1.6.1.

**I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS. The 2.0.0 -> 1.6.1 downgrade path breaks the touch-sensitive buttons, causing a voice output of ""device 2 replaced"" every time they're pressed.**

Essentially, Sony *may* have had a supply issue with the new model of batteries they wanted to use in the XM4 and ended up using the same batteries as the XM3. When the supply issues eased and they transitioned to the new batteries, a firmware update optimized for the increased voltage of the new batteries permanently damaged the earbuds using the older, lower-voltage batteries. This is a pretty convincing argument considering other pieces of information we've been drip-fed over the past year.

SonyHeadphones,WF-1000XM4 - Severe Battery Issues,"**PLEASE READ THE LATEST UPDATES AT THE BOTTOM OF THE THREAD. UPDATED NOV 3rd 2023.**

---

Starting at the end of July, there have been a large number of reports of *severe* uneven battery drain in the WF-1000XM4 earbuds. The common factor appears to be the 1.4.2 update. The most concerning symptom that some users have been reporting (myself included) is that the affected earbud is now getting hotter than expected while charging in the case.

See my running list of reports here **(has not been updated since Sep 2nd, 2022 - there are now thousands of reports)**: https://pastebin.com/H20eF2x6 Each post has numerous additional reports in the comment section. If we're seeing this much activity, it's safe to assume that this is a *much* bigger problem than represented by this subset of users.

I tried to bring this to the attention of Sony, but their call center managers unsurprisingly couldn't care less about escalating what could be a *major* issue. They *will* replace them with a brand new pair under warranty, but I have yet to receive mine and test them.

I've reached out to a number of high-profile reviewers and they're tracking this issue separately and attempting to replicate it on their end.

---

EDIT 9/7/2022: Added additional reports.

---

EDIT 9/14/2022: Added lots of additional reports. New warranty-exhange earbuds arrived with firmware version 1.5.0 installed. I'll let everyone know if the issue persists.

---

EDIT 9/16/2022: My brand new pair that shipped with 1.5.0 doesn't appear to be having the same issue (yet). There's still a ~5% difference after a few hours of use, but that's probably due to the extra processing being performed in the right earbud. I'll update this after I try to drain the case/earbuds to 0%, charge, and test again.

Note: Several people have reported that the issue is *still* present on their warranty-replacement pair, so take my update with a grain of salt.

---

EDIT 9/28/2022: The new pair that shipped with 1.5.0 *still* hasn't experienced any issues with battery life or overheating. I'm curious if maybe these ones never had 1.4.2 on them, and some of the users who reported issues with their 1.5.0 pair had them upgraded from 1.4.2 in the factory.

---

EDIT 9/29/2022: Another thought - if we're all experiencing some form of overheating while charging since upgrading to 1.4.2 (whether we catch it happening or not) this could be causing permanent damage to the battery in the affected earbud. 

This might also explain why some users running 1.5.0 have reported the issue: if it was charged in-factory while running 1.4.2, overheated, and was upgraded to 1.5.0 prior to shipping, that could explain why the issue persists.

I'll be very curious to see if the issue persists with users who upgrade to 1.5.0 after it's publicly available.

---

EDIT 10/06/2022: Added at least a dozen brand new reports from Japan. My guess is that the 1.4.2 update just released there.

Sony Japan is apparently collecting a ""collection survey"" regarding the issue (translated from a Japanese tweet).

Thanks to everyone who has contributed to this thread! If anything changes, I'll update it.

---

EDIT 11/02/2022: It looks like this downgrade tool works with the XM4 buds: https://www.mrwalkman.com/p/mdrproxyfwsidegradetool.html?m=1

Use it at your own risk. Since the battery damage is likely permanent, this may not help.

If you're stuck with a 1.4.2 set and can't exchange it, using a charger with 500ma or less may prolong its life.

---

EDIT 11/16/2022: **One user reported that downgrading resolved the issues, and another user reported that Sony Support (EU) is claiming that a firmware update will be released this month to resolve the issue.**

This gives me some hope that the vast majority of the battery issues are not permanent and replacements won't be necessary going forward. For the time being, I'd continue with the replacement process. The worst-case scenario is that you have to wait a few weeks, but end up with a brand-new pair that should have a longer lifespan.

**NOTE 03/01/2023: This has proven to be untrue. For the vast majority of users, it appears that the damage done to the battery under firmware version 1.4.2 is permanent. Earlier/later firmware versions don't *cause* the battery issues, but they don't appear to fix them either.**

https://www.sony.com/electronics/support/wireless-headphones-bluetooth-headphones/wh-1000xm4/software/00289102

I updated my headset (from 1.5.0), so I'll update this thread with the results after I've used it for a week or so.

My initial impression is that the bluetooth multipoint works very well out of the box! What a relief to finally have this feature.

---

**EDIT 03/01/2023: Battery life appears to be shorter on 2.0.0 than 1.5.0 with my set that was never affected by the battery issues, however I am using multipoint. Other reviewers have reported that 1.6.1 slightly reduced battery life in an effort to limit strain on the battery.**

Some users who were affected by the battery issues and updated to 2.0.0 report longer battery life than 1.4.2, but not significantly so. Other users are reporting shorter battery life.

One user reports that 2.0.0 caused the battery drain issue to affect the opposite earbud(!?) We'll need further confirmation of this behavior.

Once again, I think it's important to emphasize that the damage to the batteries is probably already beyond the point of repair, and an RMA is your best option if you're still on 1.4.2.

--- 

**EDIT 03/01/2023 (2): Both myself and at least two are users are reporting that the battery life reported by the app changes significantly after placing the earbuds back into the case and removing them.** In one reported case, the reported battery life jumped from 1% -> 81%. In my case, with a set unaffected by the 1.4.2 battery issues, the right earbud went from 26% to 14% and left earbud from 47% to 31% after placing and removing them from the case. **This has been an issue off and on in multiple firmware versions, but it's concerning to see it return in 2.0.0.**

Despite the dramatic change in battery percentage, mine are still within a reasonable range of each other after ~6 hours of listening.

It's too early to say if this is a bigger issue, or if it will lead to the same battery issues as 1.4.2 did, but I'll make sure to keep this updated.

**I should also note, I haven't experienced any high temps while charging on 2.0.0.**

---

**EDIT 03/07/2023: While I'm still not experiencing any major issues on 2.0.0, *many* users are reporting that their battery life is FAR worse on 2.0.0 than 1.4.2.**

These are the issues I've noticed so far on 2.0.0 with my earbuds that were *unaffected* by the 1.4.2 battery life issues:

- Slightly reduced battery life versus 1.5.0
- Miscalculation of battery percentage until replaced/removed from case (present in older versions as well)
- Occasional bluetooth multipoint roaming issues that are likely caused by the audio source rather than the earbud firmware

---

**EDIT 03/23/2023: From the *many* new comments since the 2.0.0 update, the general consensus seems to be the following:**

- The 2.0.0 update doesn't introduce any *new* battery issues, however the multipoint feature will drain your battery faster if enabled.
- The 1.4.2 -> 2.0.0 upgrade path doesn't *fix* any of the battery issues on sets affected by them, and will make them substantially worse in most cases.
- RMAing your earbuds is the only *supported* option at this point. Downgrading will not fix your issues, but may result in a marginal improvement to battery life, and may prevent additional damage to the batteries. Replacing your batteries at home *will* fixed the issues in all *reported* instances, but runs a risk of failure/destruction of your headset, and voids any warranty.

**To answer the most commonly-asked questions:**

- Yes, it's safe to update from 1.5.0 or 1.6.2 to 2.0.0, but it's probably unnecessary unless you want to take advantage of the multipoint functionality.
- No, it is not safe to update from 1.4.2 to 2.0.0. Don't do it.
- Unless you're unable to, RMAing your earbuds is absolutely **the best option.**

One more note -- a user just reported that you are able to use the earbuds independently of each other if you disable the Google Assistant functionality! Pretty cool. It will also be interesting to see if this reduces the *normal* uneven battery drain effect.

---

**EDIT 03/31/2023: The uneven drain (~15% after 6+ hours of usage) on 2.0.0 with multipoint enabled was completely resolved when I disabled Google Assistant.**

I have been having some frustrating multipoint roaming issues where one of my Windows 11 PCs will occasionally no longer transmit sound unless I connect/disconnect multiple times in a certain order. This happens after another Windows 11 PC is connected.

---

EDIT 04/14/2023: Recently, I began having real difficulty getting sound output when switching between devices when using multi-point. My phone's output worked 100% of the time, but multiple computers I connect to required me to disconnect and reconnect through the app (not from bluetooth settings), or put the buds back in the case, then take them out and reconnect. It's almost as if they're recognized as two devices under the same ID.

Why am I adding this seemingly-irrelevant issue to the thread? Because even wiping my settings, turning off multi-point, and doing a factory reset didn't fix the issue, so I decided to downgrade to 1.6.1.

**I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS. The 2.0.0 -> 1.6.1 downgrade path breaks the touch-sensitive buttons, causing a voice output of ""device 2 replaced"" every time they're pressed.**

Upgrading to 2.0.0 again resolved that issue, but I have yet to confirm if my sound output and bluetooth roaming issues are resolved as well.

These are the issues I've noticed so far on 2.0.0 with my earbuds that were *unaffected* by the 1.4.2 battery life issues:

- Slightly reduced battery life versus 1.5.0
- Miscalculation of battery percentage until replaced/removed from case (present in older versions as well)
- Occasional bluetooth multipoint roaming issues that are likely caused by the audio source rather than the earbud firmware

---

**EDIT 03/23/2023: From the *many* new comments since the 2.0.0 update, the general consensus seems to be the following:**

- The 2.0.0 update doesn't introduce any *new* battery issues, however the multipoint feature will drain your battery faster if enabled.
- The 1.4.2 -> 2.0.0 upgrade path doesn't *fix* any of the battery issues on sets affected by them, and will make them substantially worse in most cases.
- RMAing your earbuds is the only *supported* option at this point. Downgrading will not fix your issues, but may result in a marginal improvement to battery life, and may prevent additional damage to the batteries. Replacing your batteries at home *will* fixed the issues in all *reported* instances, but runs a risk of failure/destruction of your headset, and voids any warranty.

**To answer the most commonly-asked questions:**

- Yes, it's safe to update from 1.5.0 or 1.6.2 to 2.0.0, but it's probably unnecessary unless you want to take advantage of the multipoint functionality.
- No, it is not safe to update from 1.4.2 to 2.0.0. Don't do it.
- Unless you're unable to, RMAing your earbuds is absolutely **the best option.**

One more note -- a user just reported that you are able to use the earbuds independently of each other if you disable the Google Assistant functionality! Pretty cool. It will also be interesting to see if this reduces the *normal* uneven battery drain effect.

---

**EDIT 03/31/2023: The uneven drain (~15% after 6+ hours of usage) on 2.0.0 with multipoint enabled was completely resolved when I disabled Google Assistant.**

I have been having some frustrating multipoint roaming issues where one of my Windows 11 PCs will occasionally no longer transmit sound unless I connect/disconnect multiple times in a certain order. This happens after another Windows 11 PC is connected.

---

EDIT 04/14/2023: Recently, I began having real difficulty getting sound output when switching between devices when using multi-point. My phone's output worked 100% of the time, but multiple computers I connect to required me to disconnect and reconnect through the app (not from bluetooth settings), or put the buds back in the case, then take them out and reconnect. It's almost as if they're recognized as two devices under the same ID.

Why am I adding this seemingly-irrelevant issue to the thread? Because even wiping my settings, turning off multi-point, and doing a factory reset didn't fix the issue, so I decided to downgrade to 1.6.1.

**I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS. The 2.0.0 -> 1.6.1 downgrade path breaks the touch-sensitive buttons, causing a voice output of ""device 2 replaced"" every time they're pressed.**

Upgrading to 2.0.0 again resolved that issue, but I have yet to confirm if my sound output and bluetooth roaming issues are resolved as well.

Essentially, Sony *may* have had a supply issue with the new model of batteries they wanted to use in the XM4 and ended up using the same batteries as the XM3. When the supply issues eased and they transitioned to the new batteries, a firmware update optimized for the increased voltage of the new batteries permanently damaged the earbuds using the older, lower-voltage batteries. This is a pretty convincing argument considering other pieces of information we've been drip-fed over the past year.

Starting at the end of July, there have been a large number of reports of *severe* uneven battery drain in the WF-1000XM4 earbuds. The common factor appears to be the 1.4.2 update. The most concerning symptom that some users have been reporting (myself included) is that the affected earbud is now getting hotter than expected while charging in the case.

See my running list of reports here **(has not been updated since Sep 2nd, 2022 - there are now thousands of reports)**: https://pastebin.com/H20eF2x6 Each post has numerous additional reports in the comment section. If we're seeing this much activity, it's safe to assume that this is a *much* bigger problem than represented by this subset of users.

I tried to bring this to the attention of Sony, but their call center managers unsurprisingly couldn't care less about escalating what could be a *major* issue. They *will* replace them with a brand new pair under warranty, but I have yet to receive mine and test them.

I've reached out to a number of high-profile reviewers and they're tracking this issue separately and attempting to replicate it on their end.

---

EDIT 9/7/2022: Added additional reports.

---

EDIT 9/14/2022: Added lots of additional reports. New warranty-exhange earbuds arrived with firmware version 1.5.0 installed. I'll let everyone know if the issue persists.

---

EDIT 9/16/2022: My brand new pair that shipped with 1.5.0 doesn't appear to be having the same issue (yet). There's still a ~5% difference after a few hours of use, but that's probably due to the extra processing being performed in the right earbud. I'll update this after I try to drain the case/earbuds to 0%, charge, and test again.

Note: Several people have reported that the issue is *still* present on their warranty-replacement pair, so take my update with a grain of salt.

---

EDIT 9/28/2022: The new pair that shipped with 1.5.0 *still* hasn't experienced any issues with battery life or overheating. I'm curious if maybe these ones never had 1.4.2 on them, and some of the users who reported issues with their 1.5.0 pair had them upgraded from 1.4.2 in the factory.

---

EDIT 9/29/2022: Another thought - if we're all experiencing some form of overheating while charging since upgrading to 1.4.2 (whether we catch it happening or not) this could be causing permanent damage to the battery in the affected earbud. 

This might also explain why some users running 1.5.0 have reported the issue: if it was charged in-factory while running 1.4.2, overheated, and was upgraded to 1.5.0 prior to shipping, that could explain why the issue persists.

I'll be very curious to see if the issue persists with users who upgrade to 1.5.0 after it's publicly available.

Use it at your own risk. Since the battery damage is likely permanent, this may not help.

If you're stuck with a 1.4.2 set and can't exchange it, using a charger with 500ma or less may prolong its life.

---

**EDIT 02/27/2023: Firmware version 2.0.0 has been released globally with multipoint support and a roll-up of the previous battery fixes in 1.5.0 and 1.6.1.**

https://www.sony.com/electronics/support/wireless-headphones-bluetooth-headphones/wh-1000xm4/software/00289102

I updated my headset (from 1.5.0), so I'll update this thread with the results after I've used it for a week or so.

My initial impression is that the bluetooth multipoint works very well out of the box! What a relief to finally have this feature.

---

**EDIT 03/01/2023: Battery life appears to be shorter on 2.0.0 than 1.5.0 with my set that was never affected by the battery issues, however I am using multipoint. Other reviewers have reported that 1.6.1 slightly reduced battery life in an effort to limit strain on the battery.**

Some users who were affected by the battery issues and updated to 2.0.0 report longer battery life than 1.4.2, but not significantly so. Other users are reporting shorter battery life.

One user reports that 2.0.0 caused the battery drain issue to affect the opposite earbud(!?) We'll need further confirmation of this behavior.

Once again, I think it's important to emphasize that the damage to the batteries is probably already beyond the point of repair, and an RMA is your best option if you're still on 1.4.2.

--- 

**EDIT 03/01/2023 (2): Both myself and at least two are users are reporting that the battery life reported by the app changes significantly after placing the earbuds back into the case and removing them.** In one reported case, the reported battery life jumped from 1% -> 81%. In my case, with a set unaffected by the 1.4.2 battery issues, the right earbud went from 26% to 14% and left earbud from 47% to 31% after placing and removing them from the case. **This has been an issue off and on in multiple firmware versions, but it's concerning to see it return in 2.0.0.**

Despite the dramatic change in battery percentage, mine are still within a reasonable range of each other after ~6 hours of listening.

It's too early to say if this is a bigger issue, or if it will lead to the same battery issues as 1.4.2 did, but I'll make sure to keep this updated.

**I should also note, I haven't experienced any high temps while charging on 2.0.0.**

---

**EDIT 03/07/2023: While I'm still not experiencing any major issues on 2.0.0, *many* users are reporting that their battery life is FAR worse on 2.0.0 than 1.4.2.**

These are the issues I've noticed so far on 2.0.0 with my earbuds that were *unaffected* by the 1.4.2 battery life issues:

- Slightly reduced battery life versus 1.5.0
- Miscalculation of battery percentage until replaced/removed from case (present in older versions as well)

My initial impression is that the bluetooth multipoint works very well out of the box! What a relief to finally have this feature.

---

**EDIT 03/01/2023: Battery life appears to be shorter on 2.0.0 than 1.5.0 with my set that was never affected by the battery issues, however I am using multipoint. Other reviewers have reported that 1.6.1 slightly reduced battery life in an effort to limit strain on the battery.**

Some users who were affected by the battery issues and updated to 2.0.0 report longer battery life than 1.4.2, but not significantly so. Other users are reporting shorter battery life.

One user reports that 2.0.0 caused the battery drain issue to affect the opposite earbud(!?) We'll need further confirmation of this behavior.

Once again, I think it's important to emphasize that the damage to the batteries is probably already beyond the point of repair, and an RMA is your best option if you're still on 1.4.2.

--- 

**EDIT 03/01/2023 (2): Both myself and at least two are users are reporting that the battery life reported by the app changes significantly after placing the earbuds back into the case and removing them.** In one reported case, the reported battery life jumped from 1% -> 81%. In my case, with a set unaffected by the 1.4.2 battery issues, the right earbud went from 26% to 14% and left earbud from 47% to 31% after placing and removing them from the case. **This has been an issue off and on in multiple firmware versions, but it's concerning to see it return in 2.0.0.**

Despite the dramatic change in battery percentage, mine are still within a reasonable range of each other after ~6 hours of listening.

It's too early to say if this is a bigger issue, or if it will lead to the same battery issues as 1.4.2 did, but I'll make sure to keep this updated.

**I should also note, I haven't experienced any high temps while charging on 2.0.0.**

---

**EDIT 03/07/2023: While I'm still not experiencing any major issues on 2.0.0, *many* users are reporting that their battery life is FAR worse on 2.0.0 than 1.4.2.**

These are the issues I've noticed so far on 2.0.0 with my earbuds that were *unaffected* by the 1.4.2 battery life issues:

- Slightly reduced battery life versus 1.5.0
- Miscalculation of battery percentage until replaced/removed from case (present in older versions as well)
- Occasional bluetooth multipoint roaming issues that are likely caused by the audio source rather than the earbud firmware

---

**EDIT 03/23/2023: From the *many* new comments since the 2.0.0 update, the general consensus seems to be the following:**

- The 2.0.0 update doesn't introduce any *new* battery issues, however the multipoint feature will drain your battery faster if enabled.
- The 1.4.2 -> 2.0.0 upgrade path doesn't *fix* any of the battery issues on sets affected by them, and will make them substantially worse in most cases.
- RMAing your earbuds is the only *supported* option at this point. Downgrading will not fix your issues, but may result in a marginal improvement to battery life, and may prevent additional damage to the batteries. Replacing your batteries at home *will* fixed the issues in all *reported* instances, but runs a risk of failure/destruction of your headset, and voids any warranty.

**To answer the most commonly-asked questions:**

- Yes, it's safe to update from 1.5.0 or 1.6.2 to 2.0.0, but it's probably unnecessary unless you want to take advantage of the multipoint functionality.
- No, it is not safe to update from 1.4.2 to 2.0.0. Don't do it.
- Unless you're unable to, RMAing your earbuds is absolutely **the best option.**

One more note -- a user just reported that you are able to use the earbuds independently of each other if you disable the Google Assistant functionality! Pretty cool. It will also be interesting to see if this reduces the *normal* uneven battery drain effect.

---

**EDIT 03/31/2023: The uneven drain (~15% after 6+ hours of usage) on 2.0.0 with multipoint enabled was completely resolved when I disabled Google Assistant.**

I have been having some frustrating multipoint roaming issues where one of my Windows 11 PCs will occasionally no longer transmit sound unless I connect/disconnect multiple times in a certain order. This happens after another Windows 11 PC is connected.

---

EDIT 04/14/2023: Recently, I began having real difficulty getting sound output when switching between devices when using multi-point. My phone's output worked 100% of the time, but multiple computers I connect to required me to disconnect and reconnect through the app (not from bluetooth settings), or put the buds back in the case, then take them out and reconnect. It's almost as if they're recognized as two devices under the same ID.

Why am I adding this seemingly-irrelevant issue to the thread? Because even wiping my settings, turning off multi-point, and doing a factory reset didn't fix the issue, so I decided to downgrade to 1.6.1.

**I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS. The 2.0.0 -> 1.6.1 downgrade path breaks the touch-sensitive buttons, causing a voice output of ""device 2 replaced"" every time they're pressed.**

Upgrading to 2.0.0 again resolved that issue, but I have yet to confirm if my sound output and bluetooth roaming issues are resolved as well.

---

EDIT 04/20/2023: A user reported that you can resolve the touch-button issue on the 2.0.0 -> 1.6.1 downgrade path by reinstalling the English language package.

Essentially, Sony *may* have had a supply issue with the new model of batteries they wanted to use in the XM4 and ended up using the same batteries as the XM3. When the supply issues eased and they transitioned to the new batteries, a firmware update optimized for the increased voltage of the new batteries permanently damaged the earbuds using the older, lower-voltage batteries. This is a pretty convincing argument considering other pieces of information we've been drip-fed over the past year.

Starting at the end of July, there have been a large number of reports of *severe* uneven battery drain in the WF-1000XM4 earbuds. The common factor appears to be the 1.4.2 update. The most concerning symptom that some users have been reporting (myself included) is that the affected earbud is now getting hotter than expected while charging in the case.

See my running list of reports here **(has not been updated since Sep 2nd, 2022 - there are now thousands of reports)**: https://pastebin.com/H20eF2x6 Each post has numerous additional reports in the comment section. If we're seeing this much activity, it's safe to assume that this is a *much* bigger problem than represented by this subset of users.

I tried to bring this to the attention of Sony, but their call center managers unsurprisingly couldn't care less about escalating what could be a *major* issue. They *will* replace them with a brand new pair under warranty, but I have yet to receive mine and test them.

I've reached out to a number of high-profile reviewers and they're tracking this issue separately and attempting to replicate it on their end.

---

EDIT 9/7/2022: Added additional reports.

---

EDIT 9/14/2022: Added lots of additional reports. New warranty-exhange earbuds arrived with firmware version 1.5.0 installed. I'll let everyone know if the issue persists.

---

EDIT 9/16/2022: My brand new pair that shipped with 1.5.0 doesn't appear to be having the same issue (yet). There's still a ~5% difference after a few hours of use, but that's probably due to the extra processing being performed in the right earbud. I'll update this after I try to drain the case/earbuds to 0%, charge, and test again.

Note: Several people have reported that the issue is *still* present on their warranty-replacement pair, so take my update with a grain of salt.

---

EDIT 9/28/2022: The new pair that shipped with 1.5.0 *still* hasn't experienced any issues with battery life or overheating. I'm curious if maybe these ones never had 1.4.2 on them, and some of the users who reported issues with their 1.5.0 pair had them upgraded from 1.4.2 in the factory.

---

EDIT 9/29/2022: Another thought - if we're all experiencing some form of overheating while charging since upgrading to 1.4.2 (whether we catch it happening or not) this could be causing permanent damage to the battery in the affected earbud. 

This might also explain why some users running 1.5.0 have reported the issue: if it was charged in-factory while running 1.4.2, overheated, and was upgraded to 1.5.0 prior to shipping, that could explain why the issue persists.

I'll be very curious to see if the issue persists with users who upgrade to 1.5.0 after it's publicly available.

---

EDIT 10/06/2022: Added at least a dozen brand new reports from Japan. My guess is that the 1.4.2 update just released there.

Sony Japan is apparently collecting a ""collection survey"" regarding the issue (translated from a Japanese tweet).

Here's the official report: https://i.imgur.com/WANV64y.jpg

EDIT 10/25/2022: Lots of US customers are reporting that Sony is no longer hassling them about out-of-warranty returns and is replacing the earbuds with no questions asked.

Thanks to everyone who has contributed to this thread! If anything changes, I'll update it.

Something else I've noticed is that the left and right earbuds now connect to my devices independently. In the past, the right earbud had to be active in order for either to connect. Can anyone else confirm this behavior?

---

EDIT 11/02/2022: It looks like this downgrade tool works with the XM4 buds: https://www.mrwalkman.com/p/mdrproxyfwsidegradetool.html?m=1

Use it at your own risk. Since the battery damage is likely permanent, this may not help.

If you're stuck with a 1.4.2 set and can't exchange it, using a charger with 500ma or less may prolong its life.

---

EDIT 11/16/2022: **One user reported that downgrading resolved the issues, and another user reported that Sony Support (EU) is claiming that a firmware update will be released this month to resolve the issue.**

This gives me some hope that the vast majority of the battery issues are not permanent and replacements won't be necessary going forward. For the time being, I'd continue with the replacement process. The worst-case scenario is that you have to wait a few weeks, but end up with a brand-new pair that should have a longer lifespan.

**NOTE 03/01/2023: This has proven to be untrue. For the vast majority of users, it appears that the damage done to the battery under firmware version 1.4.2 is permanent. Earlier/later firmware versions don't *cause* the battery issues, but they don't appear to fix them either.**

---

EDIT 01/24/2023: **Sony USA appears to have established a common process for addressing these RMAs with the following list of questions:**

1. Have you tried the reset process?
2. Is the unit getting hot while charging?
3. Is the red light blinking on the unit?

Replacements are being honored outside of the standard warranty period. Additionally, some users report that they were able to get replacements without their original proof of purchase.

---

EDIT 02/23/2023: One user reports that connecting to a VPN node in Japan allowed them to update to 1.6.1. The prompt appeared automatically shortly after connecting and opening the app.

**As predicted in my 10/06/2022 edit, we finally have our first report of an ""exploding"" earbud. To be honest, my guess is that battery expansion progressively weakened the epoxy seal, and it finally popped apart explosively (since there's no sign of puncture or charring of the battery/case), but it's still a really bad look for Sony, especially since multiple tech media outlets are reporting on it.**

**EDIT 02/27/2023: Firmware version 2.0.0 has been released globally with multipoint support and a roll-up of the previous battery fixes in 1.5.0 and 1.6.1.**

https://www.sony.com/electronics/support/wireless-headphones-bluetooth-headphones/wh-1000xm4/software/00289102

I updated my headset (from 1.5.0), so I'll update this thread with the results after I've used it for a week or so.

My initial impression is that the bluetooth multipoint works very well out of the box! What a relief to finally have this feature.

---

**EDIT 03/01/2023: Battery life appears to be shorter on 2.0.0 than 1.5.0 with my set that was never affected by the battery issues, however I am using multipoint. Other reviewers have reported that 1.6.1 slightly reduced battery life in an effort to limit strain on the battery.**

Some users who were affected by the battery issues and updated to 2.0.0 report longer battery life than 1.4.2, but not significantly so. Other users are reporting shorter battery life.

One user reports that 2.0.0 caused the battery drain issue to affect the opposite earbud(!?) We'll need further confirmation of this behavior.

Once again, I think it's important to emphasize that the damage to the batteries is probably already beyond the point of repair, and an RMA is your best option if you're still on 1.4.2.

--- 

**EDIT 03/01/2023 (2): Both myself and at least two are users are reporting that the battery life reported by the app changes significantly after placing the earbuds back into the case and removing them.** In one reported case, the reported battery life jumped from 1% -> 81%. In my case, with a set unaffected by the 1.4.2 battery issues, the right earbud went from 26% to 14% and left earbud from 47% to 31% after placing and removing them from the case. **This has been an issue off and on in multiple firmware versions, but it's concerning to see it return in 2.0.0.**

Despite the dramatic change in battery percentage, mine are still within a reasonable range of each other after ~6 hours of listening.

It's too early to say if this is a bigger issue, or if it will lead to the same battery issues as 1.4.2 did, but I'll make sure to keep this updated.

**I should also note, I haven't experienced any high temps while charging on 2.0.0.**

---

**EDIT 03/07/2023: While I'm still not experiencing any major issues on 2.0.0, *many* users are reporting that their battery life is FAR worse on 2.0.0 than 1.4.2.**

These are the issues I've noticed so far on 2.0.0 with my earbuds that were *unaffected* by the 1.4.2 battery life issues:

- Slightly reduced battery life versus 1.5.0
- Miscalculation of battery percentage until replaced/removed from case (present in older versions as well)
- Occasional bluetooth multipoint roaming issues that are likely caused by the audio source rather than the earbud firmware

---

**EDIT 03/23/2023: From the *many* new comments since the 2.0.0 update, the general consensus seems to be the following:**

- The 2.0.0 update doesn't introduce any *new* battery issues, however the multipoint feature will drain your battery faster if enabled.
- The 1.4.2 -> 2.0.0 upgrade path doesn't *fix* any of the battery issues on sets affected by them, and will make them substantially worse in most cases.
- RMAing your earbuds is the only *supported* option at this point. Downgrading will not fix your issues, but may result in a marginal improvement to battery life, and may prevent additional damage to the batteries. Replacing your batteries at home *will* fixed the issues in all *reported* instances, but runs a risk of failure/destruction of your headset, and voids any warranty.

**To answer the most commonly-asked questions:**

- Yes, it's safe to update from 1.5.0 or 1.6.2 to 2.0.0, but it's probably unnecessary unless you want to take advantage of the multipoint functionality.
- No, it is not safe to update from 1.4.2 to 2.0.0. Don't do it.
- Unless you're unable to, RMAing your earbuds is absolutely **the best option.**

One more note -- a user just reported that you are able to use the earbuds independently of each other if you disable the Google Assistant functionality! Pretty cool. It will also be interesting to see if this reduces the *normal* uneven battery drain effect.

---

**EDIT 03/31/2023: The uneven drain (~15% after 6+ hours of usage) on 2.0.0 with multipoint enabled was completely resolved when I disabled Google Assistant.**

I have been having some frustrating multipoint roaming issues where one of my Windows 11 PCs will occasionally no longer transmit sound unless I connect/disconnect multiple times in a certain order. This happens after another Windows 11 PC is connected.

---

EDIT 04/14/2023: Recently, I began having real difficulty getting sound output when switching between devices when using multi-point. My phone's output worked 100% of the time, but multiple computers I connect to required me to disconnect and reconnect through the app (not from bluetooth settings), or put the buds back in the case, then take them out and reconnect. It's almost as if they're recognized as two devices under the same ID.

Why am I adding this seemingly-irrelevant issue to the thread? Because even wiping my settings, turning off multi-point, and doing a factory reset didn't fix the issue, so I decided to downgrade to 1.6.1.

**I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS. The 2.0.0 -> 1.6.1 downgrade path breaks the touch-sensitive buttons, causing a voice output of ""device 2 replaced"" every time they're pressed.**

Upgrading to 2.0.0 again resolved that issue, but I have yet to confirm if my sound output and bluetooth roaming issues are resolved as well.

Essentially, Sony *may* have had a supply issue with the new model of batteries they wanted to use in the XM4 and ended up using the same batteries as the XM3. When the supply issues eased and they transitioned to the new batteries, a firmware update optimized for the increased voltage of the new batteries permanently damaged the earbuds using the older, lower-voltage batteries. This is a pretty convincing argument considering other pieces of information we've been drip-fed over the past year.

Starting at the end of July, there have been a large number of reports of *severe* uneven battery drain in the WF-1000XM4 earbuds. The common factor appears to be the 1.4.2 update. The most concerning symptom that some users have been reporting (myself included) is that the affected earbud is now getting hotter than expected while charging in the case.

See my running list of reports here **(has not been updated since Sep 2nd, 2022 - there are now thousands of reports)**: https://pastebin.com/H20eF2x6 Each post has numerous additional reports in the comment section. If we're seeing this much activity, it's safe to assume that this is a *much* bigger problem than represented by this subset of users.

I tried to bring this to the attention of Sony, but their call center managers unsurprisingly couldn't care less about escalating what could be a *major* issue. They *will* replace them with a brand new pair under warranty, but I have yet to receive mine and test them.

I've reached out to a number of high-profile reviewers and they're tracking this issue separately and attempting to replicate it on their end.

---

EDIT 9/7/2022: Added additional reports.

---

EDIT 9/14/2022: Added lots of additional reports. New warranty-exhange earbuds arrived with firmware version 1.5.0 installed. I'll let everyone know if the issue persists.

---

EDIT 9/16/2022: My brand new pair that shipped with 1.5.0 doesn't appear to be having the same issue (yet). There's still a ~5% difference after a few hours of use, but that's probably due to the extra processing being performed in the right earbud. I'll update this after I try to drain the case/earbuds to 0%, charge, and test again.

Note: Several people have reported that the issue is *still* present on their warranty-replacement pair, so take my update with a grain of salt.

---

EDIT 9/28/2022: The new pair that shipped with 1.5.0 *still* hasn't experienced any issues with battery life or overheating. I'm curious if maybe these ones never had 1.4.2 on them, and some of the users who reported issues with their 1.5.0 pair had them upgraded from 1.4.2 in the factory.

---

EDIT 9/29/2022: Another thought - if we're all experiencing some form of overheating while charging since upgrading to 1.4.2 (whether we catch it happening or not) this could be causing permanent damage to the battery in the affected earbud. 

This might also explain why some users running 1.5.0 have reported the issue: if it was charged in-factory while running 1.4.2, overheated, and was upgraded to 1.5.0 prior to shipping, that could explain why the issue persists.

I'll be very curious to see if the issue persists with users who upgrade to 1.5.0 after it's publicly available.

---

EDIT 10/06/2022: Added at least a dozen brand new reports from Japan. My guess is that the 1.4.2 update just released there.

Sony Japan is apparently collecting a ""collection survey"" regarding the issue (translated from a Japanese tweet).

Here's the official report: https://i.imgur.com/WANV64y.jpg

**Here's our first battery expansion report -- in other words, this is REALLY bad for Sony: https://twitter.com/cardamon00/status/1577596298005741575**

---

EDIT 10/25/2022: Lots of US customers are reporting that Sony is no longer hassling them about out-of-warranty returns and is replacing the earbuds with no questions asked.

Thanks to everyone who has contributed to this thread! If anything changes, I'll update it.

Something else I've noticed is that the left and right earbuds now connect to my devices independently. In the past, the right earbud had to be active in order for either to connect. Can anyone else confirm this behavior?

---

EDIT 11/02/2022: It looks like this downgrade tool works with the XM4 buds: https://www.mrwalkman.com/p/mdrproxyfwsidegradetool.html?m=1

Use it at your own risk. Since the battery damage is likely permanent, this may not help.

If you're stuck with a 1.4.2 set and can't exchange it, using a charger with 500ma or less may prolong its life.

---

EDIT 11/16/2022: **One user reported that downgrading resolved the issues, and another user reported that Sony Support (EU) is claiming that a firmware update will be released this month to resolve the issue.**

This gives me some hope that the vast majority of the battery issues are not permanent and replacements won't be necessary going forward. For the time being, I'd continue with the replacement process. The worst-case scenario is that you have to wait a few weeks, but end up with a brand-new pair that should have a longer lifespan.

**NOTE 03/01/2023: This has proven to be untrue. For the vast majority of users, it appears that the damage done to the battery under firmware version 1.4.2 is permanent. Earlier/later firmware versions don't *cause* the battery issues, but they don't appear to fix them either.**

EDIT 10/25/2022: Lots of US customers are reporting that Sony is no longer hassling them about out-of-warranty returns and is replacing the earbuds with no questions asked.

Thanks to everyone who has contributed to this thread! If anything changes, I'll update it.

Something else I've noticed is that the left and right earbuds now connect to my devices independently. In the past, the right earbud had to be active in order for either to connect. Can anyone else confirm this behavior?

EDIT 11/02/2022: It looks like this downgrade tool works with the XM4 buds: https://www.mrwalkman.com/p/mdrproxyfwsidegradetool.html?m=1

Use it at your own risk. Since the battery damage is likely permanent, this may not help.

If you're stuck with a 1.4.2 set and can't exchange it, using a charger with 500ma or less may prolong its life.

---

EDIT 11/16/2022: **One user reported that downgrading resolved the issues, and another user reported that Sony Support (EU) is claiming that a firmware update will be released this month to resolve the issue.**

This gives me some hope that the vast majority of the battery issues are not permanent and replacements won't be necessary going forward. For the time being, I'd continue with the replacement process. The worst-case scenario is that you have to wait a few weeks, but end up with a brand-new pair that should have a longer lifespan.

**NOTE 03/01/2023: This has proven to be untrue. For the vast majority of users, it appears that the damage done to the battery under firmware version 1.4.2 is permanent. Earlier/later firmware versions don't *cause* the battery issues, but they don't appear to fix them either.**

---

EDIT 01/24/2023: **Sony USA appears to have established a common process for addressing these RMAs with the following list of questions:**

1. Have you tried the reset process?
2. Is the unit getting hot while charging?
3. Is the red light blinking on the unit?

Replacements are being honored outside of the standard warranty period. Additionally, some users report that they were able to get replacements without their original proof of purchase.

**EDIT 02/27/2023: Firmware version 2.0.0 has been released globally with multipoint support and a roll-up of the previous battery fixes in 1.5.0 and 1.6.1.**

https://www.sony.com/electronics/support/wireless-headphones-bluetooth-headphones/wh-1000xm4/software/00289102

I updated my headset (from 1.5.0), so I'll update this thread with the results after I've used it for a week or so.

My initial impression is that the bluetooth multipoint works very well out of the box! What a relief to finally have this feature.

---

**EDIT 03/01/2023: Battery life appears to be shorter on 2.0.0 than 1.5.0 with my set that was never affected by the battery issues, however I am using multipoint. Other reviewers have reported that 1.6.1 slightly reduced battery life in an effort to limit strain on the battery.**

Some users who were affected by the battery issues and updated to 2.0.0 report longer battery life than 1.4.2, but not significantly so. Other users are reporting shorter battery life.

One user reports that 2.0.0 caused the battery drain issue to affect the opposite earbud(!?) We'll need further confirmation of this behavior.

Once again, I think it's important to emphasize that the damage to the batteries is probably already beyond the point of repair, and an RMA is your best option if you're still on 1.4.2.

--- 

**EDIT 03/01/2023 (2): Both myself and at least two are users are reporting that the battery life reported by the app changes significantly after placing the earbuds back into the case and removing them.** In one reported case, the reported battery life jumped from 1% -> 81%. In my case, with a set unaffected by the 1.4.2 battery issues, the right earbud went from 26% to 14% and left earbud from 47% to 31% after placing and removing them from the case. **This has been an issue off and on in multiple firmware versions, but it's concerning to see it return in 2.0.0.**

Despite the dramatic change in battery percentage, mine are still within a reasonable range of each other after ~6 hours of listening.

It's too early to say if this is a bigger issue, or if it will lead to the same battery issues as 1.4.2 did, but I'll make sure to keep this updated.

**I should also note, I haven't experienced any high temps while charging on 2.0.0.**

---

**EDIT 03/07/2023: While I'm still not experiencing any major issues on 2.0.0, *many* users are reporting that their battery life is FAR worse on 2.0.0 than 1.4.2.**

These are the issues I've noticed so far on 2.0.0 with my earbuds that were *unaffected* by the 1.4.2 battery life issues:

- Slightly reduced battery life versus 1.5.0
- Miscalculation of battery percentage until replaced/removed from case (present in older versions as well)
- Occasional bluetooth multipoint roaming issues that are likely caused by the audio source rather than the earbud firmware

---

**EDIT 03/23/2023: From the *many* new comments since the 2.0.0 update, the general consensus seems to be the following:**

- The 2.0.0 update doesn't introduce any *new* battery issues, however the multipoint feature will drain your battery faster if enabled.
- The 1.4.2 -> 2.0.0 upgrade path doesn't *fix* any of the battery issues on sets affected by them, and will make them substantially worse in most cases.
- RMAing your earbuds is the only *supported* option at this point. Downgrading will not fix your issues, but may result in a marginal improvement to battery life, and may prevent additional damage to the batteries. Replacing your batteries at home *will* fixed the issues in all *reported* instances, but runs a risk of failure/destruction of your headset, and voids any warranty.

**To answer the most commonly-asked questions:**

- Yes, it's safe to update from 1.5.0 or 1.6.2 to 2.0.0, but it's probably unnecessary unless you want to take advantage of the multipoint functionality.
- No, it is not safe to update from 1.4.2 to 2.0.0. Don't do it.
- Unless you're unable to, RMAing your earbuds is absolutely **the best option.**

One more note -- a user just reported that you are able to use the earbuds independently of each other if you disable the Google Assistant functionality! Pretty cool. It will also be interesting to see if this reduces the *normal* uneven battery drain effect.

---

**EDIT 03/31/2023: The uneven drain (~15% after 6+ hours of usage) on 2.0.0 with multipoint enabled was completely resolved when I disabled Google Assistant.**

I have been having some frustrating multipoint roaming issues where one of my Windows 11 PCs will occasionally no longer transmit sound unless I connect/disconnect multiple times in a certain order. This happens after another Windows 11 PC is connected.

---

EDIT 04/14/2023: Recently, I began having real difficulty getting sound output when switching between devices when using multi-point. My phone's output worked 100% of the time, but multiple computers I connect to required me to disconnect and reconnect through the app (not from bluetooth settings), or put the buds back in the case, then take them out and reconnect. It's almost as if they're recognized as two devices under the same ID.

Why am I adding this seemingly-irrelevant issue to the thread? Because even wiping my settings, turning off multi-point, and doing a factory reset didn't fix the issue, so I decided to downgrade to 1.6.1.

**I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS. The 2.0.0 -> 1.6.1 downgrade path breaks the touch-sensitive buttons, causing a voice output of ""device 2 replaced"" every time they're pressed.**

Upgrading to 2.0.0 again resolved that issue, but I have yet to confirm if my sound output and bluetooth roaming issues are resolved as well.

---

Essentially, Sony *may* have had a supply issue with the new model of batteries they wanted to use in the XM4 and ended up using the same batteries as the XM3. When the supply issues eased and they transitioned to the new batteries, a firmware update optimized for the increased voltage of the new batteries permanently damaged the earbuds using the older, lower-voltage batteries. This is a pretty convincing argument considering other pieces of information we've been drip-fed over the past year.

---

Starting at the end of July, there have been a large number of reports of *severe* uneven battery drain in the WF-1000XM4 earbuds. The common factor appears to be the 1.4.2 update. The most concerning symptom that some users have been reporting (myself included) is that the affected earbud is now getting hotter than expected while charging in the case.

See my running list of reports here **(has not been updated since Sep 2nd, 2022 - there are now thousands of reports)**: https://pastebin.com/H20eF2x6 Each post has numerous additional reports in the comment section. If we're seeing this much activity, it's safe to assume that this is a *much* bigger problem than represented by this subset of users.

I tried to bring this to the attention of Sony, but their call center managers unsurprisingly couldn't care less about escalating what could be a *major* issue. They *will* replace them with a brand new pair under warranty, but I have yet to receive mine and test them.

I've reached out to a number of high-profile reviewers and they're tracking this issue separately and attempting to replicate it on their end.

---

EDIT 9/7/2022: Added additional reports.

---

EDIT 9/14/2022: Added lots of additional reports. New warranty-exhange earbuds arrived with firmware version 1.5.0 installed. I'll let everyone know if the issue persists.

---

EDIT 9/16/2022: My brand new pair that shipped with 1.5.0 doesn't appear to be having the same issue (yet). There's still a ~5% difference after a few hours of use, but that's probably due to the extra processing being performed in the right earbud. I'll update this after I try to drain the case/earbuds to 0%, charge, and test again.

Note: Several people have reported that the issue is *still* present on their warranty-replacement pair, so take my update with a grain of salt.

---

EDIT 9/28/2022: The new pair that shipped with 1.5.0 *still* hasn't experienced any issues with battery life or overheating. I'm curious if maybe these ones never had 1.4.2 on them, and some of the users who reported issues with their 1.5.0 pair had them upgraded from 1.4.2 in the factory.

---

EDIT 9/29/2022: Another thought - if we're all experiencing some form of overheating while charging since upgrading to 1.4.2 (whether we catch it happening or not) this could be causing permanent damage to the battery in the affected earbud. 

This might also explain why some users running 1.5.0 have reported the issue: if it was charged in-factory while running 1.4.2, overheated, and was upgraded to 1.5.0 prior to shipping, that could explain why the issue persists.

I'll be very curious to see if the issue persists with users who upgrade to 1.5.0 after it's publicly available.

---

EDIT 9/14/2022: Added lots of additional reports. New warranty-exhange earbuds arrived with firmware version 1.5.0 installed. I'll let everyone know if the issue persists.

---

EDIT 9/16/2022: My brand new pair that shipped with 1.5.0 doesn't appear to be having the same issue (yet). There's still a ~5% difference after a few hours of use, but that's probably due to the extra processing being performed in the right earbud. I'll update this after I try to drain the case/earbuds to 0%, charge, and test again.

Note: Several people have reported that the issue is *still* present on their warranty-replacement pair, so take my update with a grain of salt.

---

EDIT 9/28/2022: The new pair that shipped with 1.5.0 *still* hasn't experienced any issues with battery life or overheating. I'm curious if maybe these ones never had 1.4.2 on them, and some of the users who reported issues with their 1.5.0 pair had them upgraded from 1.4.2 in the factory.

---

EDIT 9/29/2022: Another thought - if we're all experiencing some form of overheating while charging since upgrading to 1.4.2 (whether we catch it happening or not) this could be causing permanent damage to the battery in the affected earbud. 

This might also explain why some users running 1.5.0 have reported the issue: if it was charged in-factory while running 1.4.2, overheated, and was upgraded to 1.5.0 prior to shipping, that could explain why the issue persists.

I'll be very curious to see if the issue persists with users who upgrade to 1.5.0 after it's publicly available.

---

EDIT 10/06/2022: Added at least a dozen brand new reports from Japan. My guess is that the 1.4.2 update just released there.

Sony Japan is apparently collecting a ""collection survey"" regarding the issue (translated from a Japanese tweet).

Here's the official report: https://i.imgur.com/WANV64y.jpg

**Here's our first battery expansion report -- in other words, this is REALLY bad for Sony: https://twitter.com/cardamon00/status/1577596298005741575**

---

EDIT 10/25/2022: Lots of US customers are reporting that Sony is no longer hassling them about out-of-warranty returns and is replacing the earbuds with no questions asked.

Thanks to everyone who has contributed to this thread! If anything changes, I'll update it.

Something else I've noticed is that the left and right earbuds now connect to my devices independently. In the past, the right earbud had to be active in order for either to connect. Can anyone else confirm this behavior?

---

EDIT 11/02/2022: It looks like this downgrade tool works with the XM4 buds: https://www.mrwalkman.com/p/mdrproxyfwsidegradetool.html?m=1

Use it at your own risk. Since the battery damage is likely permanent, this may not help.

If you're stuck with a 1.4.2 set and can't exchange it, using a charger with 500ma or less may prolong its life.

---

EDIT 11/16/2022: **One user reported that downgrading resolved the issues, and another user reported that Sony Support (EU) is claiming that a firmware update will be released this month to resolve the issue.**

This gives me some hope that the vast majority of the battery issues are not permanent and replacements won't be necessary going forward. For the time being, I'd continue with the replacement process. The worst-case scenario is that you have to wait a few weeks, but end up with a brand-new pair that should have a longer lifespan.

**NOTE 03/01/2023: This has proven to be untrue. For the vast majority of users, it appears that the damage done to the battery under firmware version 1.4.2 is permanent. Earlier/later firmware versions don't *cause* the battery issues, but they don't appear to fix them either.**

---

EDIT 01/24/2023: **Sony USA appears to have established a common process for addressing these RMAs with the following list of questions:**

1. Have you tried the reset process?
2. Is the unit getting hot while charging?
3. Is the red light blinking on the unit?

Replacements are being honored outside of the standard warranty period. Additionally, some users report that they were able to get replacements without their original proof of purchase.

---

EDIT 02/23/2023: One user reports that connecting to a VPN node in Japan allowed them to update to 1.6.1. The prompt appeared automatically shortly after connecting and opening the app.

**As predicted in my 10/06/2022 edit, we finally have our first report of an ""exploding"" earbud.

**EDIT 02/27/2023: Firmware version 2.0.0 has been released globally with multipoint support and a roll-up of the previous battery fixes in 1.5.0 and 1.6.1.**

https://www.sony.com/electronics/support/wireless-headphones-bluetooth-headphones/wh-1000xm4/software/00289102

I updated my headset (from 1.5.0), so I'll update this thread with the results after I've used it for a week or so.

My initial impression is that the bluetooth multipoint works very well out of the box! What a relief to finally have this feature.

---

**EDIT 03/01/2023: Battery life appears to be shorter on 2.0.0 than 1.5.0 with my set that was never affected by the battery issues, however I am using multipoint. Other reviewers have reported that 1.6.1 slightly reduced battery life in an effort to limit strain on the battery.**

Some users who were affected by the battery issues and updated to 2.0.0 report longer battery life than 1.4.2, but not significantly so. Other users are reporting shorter battery life.

One user reports that 2.0.0 caused the battery drain issue to affect the opposite earbud(!?) We'll need further confirmation of this behavior.

Once again, I think it's important to emphasize that the damage to the batteries is probably already beyond the point of repair, and an RMA is your best option if you're still on 1.4.2.

--- 

**EDIT 03/01/2023 (2): Both myself and at least two are users are reporting that the battery life reported by the app changes significantly after placing the earbuds back into the case and removing them.** In one reported case, the reported battery life jumped from 1% -> 81%. In my case, with a set unaffected by the 1.4.2 battery issues, the right earbud went from 26% to 14% and left earbud from 47% to 31% after placing and removing them from the case. **This has been an issue off and on in multiple firmware versions, but it's concerning to see it return in 2.0.0.**

Despite the dramatic change in battery percentage, mine are still within a reasonable range of each other after ~6 hours of listening.

It's too early to say if this is a bigger issue, or if it will lead to the same battery issues as 1.4.2 did, but I'll make sure to keep this updated.

**I should also note, I haven't experienced any high temps while charging on 2.0.0.**

---

**EDIT 03/07/2023: While I'm still not experiencing any major issues on 2.0.0, *many* users are reporting that their battery life is FAR worse on 2.0.0 than 1.4.2.**

These are the issues I've noticed so far on 2.0.0 with my earbuds that were *unaffected* by the 1.4.2 battery life issues:

- Slightly reduced battery life versus 1.5.0
- Miscalculation of battery percentage until replaced/removed from case (present in older versions as well)
- Occasional bluetooth multipoint roaming issues that are likely caused by the audio source rather than the earbud firmware

---

**EDIT 03/23/2023: From the *many* new comments since the 2.0.0 update, the general consensus seems to be the following:**

- The 2.0.0 update doesn't introduce any *new* battery issues, however the multipoint feature will drain your battery faster if enabled.
- The 1.4.2 -> 2.0.0 upgrade path doesn't *fix* any of the battery issues on sets affected by them, and will make them substantially worse in most cases.
- RMAing your earbuds is the only *supported* option at this point. Downgrading will not fix your issues, but may result in a marginal improvement to battery life, and may prevent additional damage to the batteries. Replacing your batteries at home *will* fixed the issues in all *reported* instances, but runs a risk of failure/destruction of your headset, and voids any warranty.

**To answer the most commonly-asked questions:**

- Yes, it's safe to update from 1.5.0 or 1.6.2 to 2.0.0, but it's probably unnecessary unless you want to take advantage of the multipoint functionality.
- No, it is not safe to update from 1.4.2 to 2.0.0. Don't do it.
- Unless you're unable to, RMAing your earbuds is absolutely **the best option.**

One more note -- a user just reported that you are able to use the earbuds independently of each other if you disable the Google Assistant functionality! Pretty cool. It will also be interesting to see if this reduces the *normal* uneven battery drain effect.

---

**EDIT 03/31/2023: The uneven drain (~15% after 6+ hours of usage) on 2.0.0 with multipoint enabled was completely resolved when I disabled Google Assistant.**

I have been having some frustrating multipoint roaming issues where one of my Windows 11 PCs will occasionally no longer transmit sound unless I connect/disconnect multiple times in a certain order. This happens after another Windows 11 PC is connected.

---

EDIT 04/14/2023: Recently, I began having real difficulty getting sound output when switching between devices when using multi-point. My phone's output worked 100% of the time, but multiple computers I connect to required me to disconnect and reconnect through the app (not from bluetooth settings), or put the buds back in the case, then take them out and reconnect. It's almost as if they're recognized as two devices under the same ID.

Why am I adding this seemingly-irrelevant issue to the thread? Because even wiping my settings, turning off multi-point, and doing a factory reset didn't fix the issue, so I decided to downgrade to 1.6.1.

**I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS. The 2.0.0 -> 1.6.1 downgrade path breaks the touch-sensitive buttons, causing a voice output of ""device 2 replaced"" every time they're pressed.**

Upgrading to 2.0.0 again resolved that issue, but I have yet to confirm if my sound output and bluetooth roaming issues are resolved as well.

---

Essentially, Sony *may* have had a supply issue with the new model of batteries they wanted to use in the XM4 and ended up using the same batteries as the XM3. When the supply issues eased and they transitioned to the new batteries, a firmware update optimized for the increased voltage of the new batteries permanently damaged the earbuds using the older, lower-voltage batteries. This is a pretty convincing argument considering other pieces of information we've been drip-fed over the past year.

**EDIT 09/06/2023:** For those still interested in an RCA for the issue, one Reddit user reports that the explanation in the previous edit doesn't align with their experience. In their case, the battery issue was occurring despite their unit having the newer model of batteries:

In another thread a Reddit user reported that Sony exchanged an RMA'd pair of XM4s for a new set of XM5s. Nice!

**EDIT 10/30/2023:** In the USA there's currently a 3-month backorder on WF-1000XM4 replacement sets. Sony is currently offering refunds to (presumably) *all* customers with a valid receipt.

**EDIT 11/03/2023:** I originally removed this from the post because I believed it to be speculation, but I've seen quite a few reports that there are similar battery issues affecting the WF-1000XM5s. In fact, one user reports that they've gone through multiple RMAs *and* that they have friends who've encountered the same issues on their XM5s.

To add to the frustration, it seems that the offer that Sony USA is giving XM4 RMA requesters (refunds or upgrades to the XM5) isn't being honored worldwide. A few users have even said that Sony isn't acknowledging *any* issues in certain countries.

--- 

**EDIT 02/14/2024:** One user reports that United Repairs has the parts for the XM4s back in stock, so they're repairing rather than replacing them.

SonyHeadphones,WF-1000XM4 - Severe Battery Issues,"**PLEASE READ THE LATEST UPDATES AT THE BOTTOM OF THE THREAD. UPDATED NOV 3rd 2023.**

---

Starting at the end of July, there have been a large number of reports of *severe* uneven battery drain in the WF-1000XM4 earbuds. The common factor appears to be the 1.4.2 update. The most concerning symptom that some users have been reporting (myself included) is that the affected earbud is now getting hotter than expected while charging in the case.

See my running list of reports here **(has not been updated since Sep 2nd, 2022 - there are now thousands of reports)**: https://pastebin.com/H20eF2x6 Each post has numerous additional reports in the comment section. If we're seeing this much activity, it's safe to assume that this is a *much* bigger problem than represented by this subset of users.

I tried to bring this to the attention of Sony, but their call center managers unsurprisingly couldn't care less about escalating what could be a *major* issue. They *will* replace them with a brand new pair under warranty, but I have yet to receive mine and test them.

I've reached out to a number of high-profile reviewers and they're tracking this issue separately and attempting to replicate it on their end.

EDIT 9/16/2022: My brand new pair that shipped with 1.5.0 doesn't appear to be having the same issue (yet).

Starting at the end of July, there have been a large number of reports of *severe* uneven battery drain in the WF-1000XM4 earbuds. The common factor appears to be the 1.4.2 update. The most concerning symptom that some users have been reporting (myself included) is that the affected earbud is now getting hotter than expected while charging in the case.

See my running list of reports here **(has not been updated since Sep 2nd, 2022 - there are now thousands of reports)**: https://pastebin.com/H20eF2x6 Each post has numerous additional reports in the comment section. If we're seeing this much activity, it's safe to assume that this is a *much* bigger problem than represented by this subset of users.

I tried to bring this to the attention of Sony, but their call center managers unsurprisingly couldn't care less about escalating what could be a *major* issue. They *will* replace them with a brand new pair under warranty, but I have yet to receive mine and test them.

I've reached out to a number of high-profile reviewers and they're tracking this issue separately and attempting to replicate it on their end.

---

EDIT 9/7/2022: Added additional reports.

---

EDIT 9/14/2022: Added lots of additional reports. New warranty-exhange earbuds arrived with firmware version 1.5.0 installed. I'll let everyone know if the issue persists.

---

EDIT 9/16/2022: My brand new pair that shipped with 1.5.0 doesn't appear to be having the same issue (yet). There's still a ~5% difference after a few hours of use, but that's probably due to the extra processing being performed in the right earbud. I'll update this after I try to drain the case/earbuds to 0%, charge, and test again.

Note: Several people have reported that the issue is *still* present on their warranty-replacement pair, so take my update with a grain of salt.

---

EDIT 9/28/2022: The new pair that shipped with 1.5.0 *still* hasn't experienced any issues with battery life or overheating. I'm curious if maybe these ones never had 1.4.2 on them, and some of the users who reported issues with their 1.5.0 pair had them upgraded from 1.4.2 in the factory.

---

EDIT 9/29/2022: Another thought - if we're all experiencing some form of overheating while charging since upgrading to 1.4.2 (whether we catch it happening or not) this could be causing permanent damage to the battery in the affected earbud. 

This might also explain why some users running 1.5.0 have reported the issue: if it was charged in-factory while running 1.4.2, overheated, and was upgraded to 1.5.0 prior to shipping, that could explain why the issue persists.

I'll be very curious to see if the issue persists with users who upgrade to 1.5.0 after it's publicly available.

---

EDIT 10/06/2022: Added at least a dozen brand new reports from Japan. My guess is that the 1.4.2 update just released there.

Sony Japan is apparently collecting a ""collection survey"" regarding the issue (translated from a Japanese tweet).

Thanks to everyone who has contributed to this thread! If anything changes, I'll update it.

Use it at your own risk. Since the battery damage is likely permanent, this may not help.

If you're stuck with a 1.4.2 set and can't exchange it, using a charger with 500ma or less may prolong its life.

---

EDIT 11/16/2022: **One user reported that downgrading resolved the issues, and another user reported that Sony Support (EU) is claiming that a firmware update will be released this month to resolve the issue.**

This gives me some hope that the vast majority of the battery issues are not permanent and replacements won't be necessary going forward. For the time being, I'd continue with the replacement process. The worst-case scenario is that you have to wait a few weeks, but end up with a brand-new pair that should have a longer lifespan.

**NOTE 03/01/2023: This has proven to be untrue. For the vast majority of users, it appears that the damage done to the battery under firmware version 1.4.2 is permanent. Earlier/later firmware versions don't *cause* the battery issues, but they don't appear to fix them either.**

---

1. Have you tried the reset process?

I updated my headset (from 1.5.0), so I'll update this thread with the results after I've used it for a week or so.

My initial impression is that the bluetooth multipoint works very well out of the box! What a relief to finally have this feature.

---

**EDIT 03/01/2023: Battery life appears to be shorter on 2.0.0 than 1.5.0 with my set that was never affected by the battery issues, however I am using multipoint. Other reviewers have reported that 1.6.1 slightly reduced battery life in an effort to limit strain on the battery.**

Some users who were affected by the battery issues and updated to 2.0.0 report longer battery life than 1.4.2, but not significantly so. Other users are reporting shorter battery life.

One user reports that 2.0.0 caused the battery drain issue to affect the opposite earbud(!?) We'll need further confirmation of this behavior.

Once again, I think it's important to emphasize that the damage to the batteries is probably already beyond the point of repair, and an RMA is your best option if you're still on 1.4.2.

--- 

**EDIT 03/01/2023 (2): Both myself and at least two are users are reporting that the battery life reported by the app changes significantly after placing the earbuds back into the case and removing them.** In one reported case, the reported battery life jumped from 1% -> 81%. In my case, with a set unaffected by the 1.4.2 battery issues, the right earbud went from 26% to 14% and left earbud from 47% to 31% after placing and removing them from the case. **This has been an issue off and on in multiple firmware versions, but it's concerning to see it return in 2.0.0.**

Despite the dramatic change in battery percentage, mine are still within a reasonable range of each other after ~6 hours of listening.

It's too early to say if this is a bigger issue, or if it will lead to the same battery issues as 1.4.2 did, but I'll make sure to keep this updated.

**I should also note, I haven't experienced any high temps while charging on 2.0.0.**

---

**EDIT 03/07/2023: While I'm still not experiencing any major issues on 2.0.0, *many* users are reporting that their battery life is FAR worse on 2.0.0 than 1.4.2.**

These are the issues I've noticed so far on 2.0.0 with my earbuds that were *unaffected* by the 1.4.2 battery life issues:

- Slightly reduced battery life versus 1.5.0
- Miscalculation of battery percentage until replaced/removed from case (present in older versions as well)
- Occasional bluetooth multipoint roaming issues that are likely caused by the audio source rather than the earbud firmware

---

**EDIT 03/23/2023: From the *many* new comments since the 2.0.0 update, the general consensus seems to be the following:**

- The 2.0.0 update doesn't introduce any *new* battery issues, however the multipoint feature will drain your battery faster if enabled.
- The 1.4.2 -> 2.0.0 upgrade path doesn't *fix* any of the battery issues on sets affected by them, and will make them substantially worse in most cases.
- RMAing your earbuds is the only *supported* option at this point. Downgrading will not fix your issues, but may result in a marginal improvement to battery life, and may prevent additional damage to the batteries. Replacing your batteries at home *will* fixed the issues in all *reported* instances, but runs a risk of failure/destruction of your headset, and voids any warranty.

**To answer the most commonly-asked questions:**

- Yes, it's safe to update from 1.5.0 or 1.6.2 to 2.0.0, but it's probably unnecessary unless you want to take advantage of the multipoint functionality.
- No, it is not safe to update from 1.4.2 to 2.0.0. Don't do it.
- Unless you're unable to, RMAing your earbuds is absolutely **the best option.**

One more note -- a user just reported that you are able to use the earbuds independently of each other if you disable the Google Assistant functionality! Pretty cool. It will also be interesting to see if this reduces the *normal* uneven battery drain effect.

---

**EDIT 03/31/2023: The uneven drain (~15% after 6+ hours of usage) on 2.0.0 with multipoint enabled was completely resolved when I disabled Google Assistant.**

I have been having some frustrating multipoint roaming issues where one of my Windows 11 PCs will occasionally no longer transmit sound unless I connect/disconnect multiple times in a certain order. This happens after another Windows 11 PC is connected.

---

EDIT 04/14/2023: Recently, I began having real difficulty getting sound output when switching between devices when using multi-point. My phone's output worked 100% of the time, but multiple computers I connect to required me to disconnect and reconnect through the app (not from bluetooth settings), or put the buds back in the case, then take them out and reconnect. It's almost as if they're recognized as two devices under the same ID.

Why am I adding this seemingly-irrelevant issue to the thread? Because even wiping my settings, turning off multi-point, and doing a factory reset didn't fix the issue, so I decided to downgrade to 1.6.1.

**I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS. The 2.0.0 -> 1.6.1 downgrade path breaks the touch-sensitive buttons, causing a voice output of ""device 2 replaced"" every time they're pressed.**

Upgrading to 2.0.0 again resolved that issue, but I have yet to confirm if my sound output and bluetooth roaming issues are resolved as well.

Essentially, Sony *may* have had a supply issue with the new model of batteries they wanted to use in the XM4 and ended up using the same batteries as the XM3. When the supply issues eased and they transitioned to the new batteries, a firmware update optimized for the increased voltage of the new batteries permanently damaged the earbuds using the older, lower-voltage batteries. This is a pretty convincing argument considering other pieces of information we've been drip-fed over the past year.

**UPDATE 9/14/2023: This theory has been pretty thoroughly refuted by new evidence.**

---

**EDIT 09/06/2023:** For those still interested in an RCA for the issue, one Reddit user reports that the explanation in the previous edit doesn't align with their experience. In their case, the battery issue was occurring despite their unit having the newer model of batteries: 

> Just replaced battery manually following youtube guides. I don't think the old model of battery is the problem because in my case the old battery which was causing the problem is the same model (Z55H) as the new one.

In another thread a Reddit user reported that Sony exchanged an RMA'd pair of XM4s for a new set of XM5s. Nice!

---

**EDIT 10/30/2023:** In the USA there's currently a 3-month backorder on WF-1000XM4 replacement sets. Sony is currently offering refunds to (presumably) *all* customers with a valid receipt.

To add to the frustration, it seems that the offer that Sony USA is giving XM4 RMA requesters (refunds or upgrades to the XM5) isn't being honored worldwide. A few users have even said that Sony isn't acknowledging *any* issues in certain countries.

Essentially, Sony *may* have had a supply issue with the new model of batteries they wanted to use in the XM4 and ended up using the same batteries as the XM3. When the supply issues eased and they transitioned to the new batteries, a firmware update optimized for the increased voltage of the new batteries permanently damaged the earbuds using the older, lower-voltage batteries. This is a pretty convincing argument considering other pieces of information we've been drip-fed over the past year.

SonyHeadphones,WF-1000XM4 - Severe Battery Issues,"**PLEASE READ THE LATEST UPDATES AT THE BOTTOM OF THE THREAD. UPDATED NOV 3rd 2023.**

---

Starting at the end of July, there have been a large number of reports of *severe* uneven battery drain in the WF-1000XM4 earbuds. The common factor appears to be the 1.4.2 update. The most concerning symptom that some users have been reporting (myself included) is that the affected earbud is now getting hotter than expected while charging in the case.

See my running list of reports here **(has not been updated since Sep 2nd, 2022 - there are now thousands of reports)**: https://pastebin.com/H20eF2x6 Each post has numerous additional reports in the comment section. If we're seeing this much activity, it's safe to assume that this is a *much* bigger problem than represented by this subset of users.

I tried to bring this to the attention of Sony, but their call center managers unsurprisingly couldn't care less about escalating what could be a *major* issue. They *will* replace them with a brand new pair under warranty, but I have yet to receive mine and test them.

I've reached out to a number of high-profile reviewers and they're tracking this issue separately and attempting to replicate it on their end.

---

EDIT 9/7/2022: Added additional reports.

---

EDIT 9/14/2022: Added lots of additional reports. New warranty-exhange earbuds arrived with firmware version 1.5.0 installed. I'll let everyone know if the issue persists.

---

EDIT 9/16/2022: My brand new pair that shipped with 1.5.0 doesn't appear to be having the same issue (yet). There's still a ~5% difference after a few hours of use, but that's probably due to the extra processing being performed in the right earbud. I'll update this after I try to drain the case/earbuds to 0%, charge, and test again.

Note: Several people have reported that the issue is *still* present on their warranty-replacement pair, so take my update with a grain of salt.

---

EDIT 9/28/2022: The new pair that shipped with 1.5.0 *still* hasn't experienced any issues with battery life or overheating. I'm curious if maybe these ones never had 1.4.2 on them, and some of the users who reported issues with their 1.5.0 pair had them upgraded from 1.4.2 in the factory.

---

EDIT 9/29/2022: Another thought - if we're all experiencing some form of overheating while charging since upgrading to 1.4.2 (whether we catch it happening or not) this could be causing permanent damage to the battery in the affected earbud. 

This might also explain why some users running 1.5.0 have reported the issue: if it was charged in-factory while running 1.4.2, overheated, and was upgraded to 1.5.0 prior to shipping, that could explain why the issue persists.

I'll be very curious to see if the issue persists with users who upgrade to 1.5.0 after it's publicly available.

---

EDIT 10/06/2022: Added at least a dozen brand new reports from Japan. My guess is that the 1.4.2 update just released there.

Sony Japan is apparently collecting a ""collection survey"" regarding the issue (translated from a Japanese tweet).

Here's the official report: https://i.imgur.com/WANV64y.jpg

**Here's our first battery expansion report -- in other words, this is REALLY bad for Sony: https://twitter.com/cardamon00/status/1577596298005741575**

---

EDIT 10/25/2022: Lots of US customers are reporting that Sony is no longer hassling them about out-of-warranty returns and is replacing the earbuds with no questions asked.

Thanks to everyone who has contributed to this thread! If anything changes, I'll update it.

Something else I've noticed is that the left and right earbuds now connect to my devices independently. In the past, the right earbud had to be active in order for either to connect. Can anyone else confirm this behavior?

---

EDIT 11/02/2022: It looks like this downgrade tool works with the XM4 buds: https://www.mrwalkman.com/p/mdrproxyfwsidegradetool.html?m=1

Use it at your own risk. Since the battery damage is likely permanent, this may not help.

If you're stuck with a 1.4.2 set and can't exchange it, using a charger with 500ma or less may prolong its life.

---

EDIT 11/16/2022: **One user reported that downgrading resolved the issues, and another user reported that Sony Support (EU) is claiming that a firmware update will be released this month to resolve the issue.**

This gives me some hope that the vast majority of the battery issues are not permanent and replacements won't be necessary going forward. For the time being, I'd continue with the replacement process. The worst-case scenario is that you have to wait a few weeks, but end up with a brand-new pair that should have a longer lifespan.

**NOTE 03/01/2023: This has proven to be untrue. For the vast majority of users, it appears that the damage done to the battery under firmware version 1.4.2 is permanent. Earlier/later firmware versions don't *cause* the battery issues, but they don't appear to fix them either.**

---

EDIT 01/24/2023: **Sony USA appears to have established a common process for addressing these RMAs with the following list of questions:**

1. Have you tried the reset process?
2. Is the unit getting hot while charging?
3. Is the red light blinking on the unit?

Replacements are being honored outside of the standard warranty period. Additionally, some users report that they were able to get replacements without their original proof of purchase.

---

EDIT 02/23/2023: One user reports that connecting to a VPN node in Japan allowed them to update to 1.6.1. The prompt appeared automatically shortly after connecting and opening the app.

**As predicted in my 10/06/2022 edit, we finally have our first report of an ""exploding"" earbud. To be honest, my guess is that battery expansion progressively weakened the epoxy seal, and it finally popped apart explosively (since there's no sign of puncture or charring of the battery/case), but it's still a really bad look for Sony, especially since multiple tech media outlets are reporting on it.**

https://www.reddit.com/r/SonyHeadphones/comments/117ueiy/wf1000xm4_battery_exploded_while_in_charging_case/

---

**EDIT 02/27/2023: Firmware version 2.0.0 has been released globally with multipoint support and a roll-up of the previous battery fixes in 1.5.0 and 1.6.1.**

https://www.sony.com/electronics/support/wireless-headphones-bluetooth-headphones/wh-1000xm4/software/00289102

I updated my headset (from 1.5.0), so I'll update this thread with the results after I've used it for a week or so.

My initial impression is that the bluetooth multipoint works very well out of the box! What a relief to finally have this feature.

---

**EDIT 03/01/2023: Battery life appears to be shorter on 2.0.0 than 1.5.0 with my set that was never affected by the battery issues, however I am using multipoint. Other reviewers have reported that 1.6.1 slightly reduced battery life in an effort to limit strain on the battery.**

Some users who were affected by the battery issues and updated to 2.0.0 report longer battery life than 1.4.2, but not significantly so. Other users are reporting shorter battery life.

One user reports that 2.0.0 caused the battery drain issue to affect the opposite earbud(!?) We'll need further confirmation of this behavior.

Once again, I think it's important to emphasize that the damage to the batteries is probably already beyond the point of repair, and an RMA is your best option if you're still on 1.4.2.

--- 

**EDIT 03/01/2023 (2): Both myself and at least two are users are reporting that the battery life reported by the app changes significantly after placing the earbuds back into the case and removing them.** In one reported case, the reported battery life jumped from 1% -> 81%. In my case, with a set unaffected by the 1.4.2 battery issues, the right earbud went from 26% to 14% and left earbud from 47% to 31% after placing and removing them from the case. **This has been an issue off and on in multiple firmware versions, but it's concerning to see it return in 2.0.0.**

Despite the dramatic change in battery percentage, mine are still within a reasonable range of each other after ~6 hours of listening.

It's too early to say if this is a bigger issue, or if it will lead to the same battery issues as 1.4.2 did, but I'll make sure to keep this updated.

**I should also note, I haven't experienced any high temps while charging on 2.0.0.**

---

**EDIT 03/07/2023: While I'm still not experiencing any major issues on 2.0.0, *many* users are reporting that their battery life is FAR worse on 2.0.0 than 1.4.2.**

These are the issues I've noticed so far on 2.0.0 with my earbuds that were *unaffected* by the 1.4.2 battery life issues:

- Slightly reduced battery life versus 1.5.0
- Miscalculation of battery percentage until replaced/removed from case (present in older versions as well)
- Occasional bluetooth multipoint roaming issues that are likely caused by the audio source rather than the earbud firmware

---

**EDIT 03/23/2023: From the *many* new comments since the 2.0.0 update, the general consensus seems to be the following:**

- The 2.0.0 update doesn't introduce any *new* battery issues, however the multipoint feature will drain your battery faster if enabled.
- The 1.4.2 -> 2.0.0 upgrade path doesn't *fix* any of the battery issues on sets affected by them, and will make them substantially worse in most cases.
- RMAing your earbuds is the only *supported* option at this point. Downgrading will not fix your issues, but may result in a marginal improvement to battery life, and may prevent additional damage to the batteries. Replacing your batteries at home *will* fixed the issues in all *reported* instances, but runs a risk of failure/destruction of your headset, and voids any warranty.

**To answer the most commonly-asked questions:**

- Yes, it's safe to update from 1.5.0 or 1.6.2 to 2.0.0, but it's probably unnecessary unless you want to take advantage of the multipoint functionality.
- No, it is not safe to update from 1.4.2 to 2.0.0. Don't do it.
- Unless you're unable to, RMAing your earbuds is absolutely **the best option.**

One more note -- a user just reported that you are able to use the earbuds independently of each other if you disable the Google Assistant functionality! Pretty cool. It will also be interesting to see if this reduces the *normal* uneven battery drain effect.

---

**EDIT 03/31/2023: The uneven drain (~15% after 6+ hours of usage) on 2.0.0 with multipoint enabled was completely resolved when I disabled Google Assistant.**

I have been having some frustrating multipoint roaming issues where one of my Windows 11 PCs will occasionally no longer transmit sound unless I connect/disconnect multiple times in a certain order. This happens after another Windows 11 PC is connected.

---

EDIT 04/14/2023: Recently, I began having real difficulty getting sound output when switching between devices when using multi-point. My phone's output worked 100% of the time, but multiple computers I connect to required me to disconnect and reconnect through the app (not from bluetooth settings), or put the buds back in the case, then take them out and reconnect. It's almost as if they're recognized as two devices under the same ID.

Why am I adding this seemingly-irrelevant issue to the thread? Because even wiping my settings, turning off multi-point, and doing a factory reset didn't fix the issue, so I decided to downgrade to 1.6.1.

**I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS. The 2.0.0 -> 1.6.1 downgrade path breaks the touch-sensitive buttons, causing a voice output of ""device 2 replaced"" every time they're pressed.**

Upgrading to 2.0.0 again resolved that issue, but I have yet to confirm if my sound output and bluetooth roaming issues are resolved as well.

---

EDIT 04/20/2023: A user reported that you can resolve the touch-button issue on the 2.0.0 -> 1.6.1 downgrade path by reinstalling the English language package.

Another user reported that changing the language in the headphones app under Notification & Voice Guide to another language and then back to English fixed it.

---

EDIT 04/25/2023: Another battery expansion report by a fellow Redditor: https://www.reddit.com/r/SonyHeadphones/comments/12yuf7o/my_wf_xm4s_finally_bit_it/

EDIT 05/01/2023: One user reported that a Sony rep. let it slip that both the batteries in the original run *and* the 1.4.2 software update are to blame for the issues.

headphones,NHD: Sony WH-1000XM4 - Pure disappointment," https://imgur.com/a/w0X2NVs

I got the Sony WH1000XM4 yesterday. This was supposed to be the flagship model and I'm disappointed. I wanted them for a few years and I waited until now to get them on a BF sale. I'm so glad that I did because these are not worth the full price.
I'll share my opinion here. Maybe there are fixes or compromises what could make the experience better. If you have any, fell free to share.

I knew before buying that they're made out of plastic with a soft touch finish. It reminds me of cheaper Chinese electronics that are a finger grease magnet. Here the execution is a little better and hopefully it's more durable. 
The headphones don't feel cheap but they don't feel great either.
What feels cheap are the ear pads. They are made out of faux leather that has small creases that make them look used. 
After five minutes of use they looked like a glazed donut. I don't know if it was from sweat or skin oils. I worn leather and velur pads that didn't show signs of wear for months. 

The headphones are noice canceling which means they should have passive noice canceling plus ANC, but ironically, it feels like everything is louder when I put the headphones on. No, the ambiance mode or whatever is called is not on. The headphones were turned off. 
ANC works fairly well. There's a high frequency whine but I expected that. The problem is that after a few minutes my ears get plugged and the headphones lose detail and soundstage. It actually gets so bad that my ear canals and ears hurt and ring like I had IEM's jammed in my ear canals and volume on full blast. I was watching a movie in the evening and the next morning my ears were still ringing. I had the volume under 20% since I don't like loudness. I don't know if I'll be able to use them at all.
The ANC also takes away a lot of soundstage and sound quality when enabled. 

I have a problem with ANC where one side produces weird sounds, scratching and glitches. It's loud and it gets annoying. I don't know if that's normal or my pair is defective.

One of the reasons I got this model is so I don't have to go through multiple cheap headphones and deal with their faults. Sadly, it's exactly what I got. Like cheap Chinese headphones, this model has action notifications and verbal notifications. ""Bluetooth on"", ""Bluetooth connected"", ""Volume up"" and so on. It's too loud and annoying. The reviews claimed you can turn them off but you can't fully. Instead of ""BEEP Next song"" you get just ""BEEP"". Great..

The custom button is advertised as programmable but the only thing you can do with it is to choose between Google assistant, Alexa and some third option. Absolutely useless like the side touch panel that is not customizable or precise. Many times I went to adjust the sound level and it switched to the next song.

The app shouldn't be needed, there's too much privacy concerns and data sharing, the EQ settings seem rudimental because you have 5 frequency settings and so on.

I honestly feel it would be better if I got low profile 3M ear muffs that I would put over my Bluetooth IEMs. The sound quality would be better.

To be clear, I don't have expensive DACs, amps and headphones that spoiled Ms and yet I'm disappointed. I'm especially concerned about the ringing in my ears that I'm experiencing even now while writing this although I haven't used the headphones for the last eight hours. When I did, it was on the lowest or second lowest volume level on Android. The volume jumps are also too high for me.",2022-12-08 22:01:44,what noise canceling over-the-ear headphones do you suggest?,2023-03-26 15:43:07,After
