SonyHeadphones,WH-1000XM4 High Pitched Noise in Left Ear Cup When Partially Lifted,I just got the Sony WH-1000XM4 headphones today and I get a super loud high pitched tinnitus like noise when the left ear cup is partially lifted. So as I’m putting them on/taking off I get this. If I break the seal and slightly lift the left ear cup I get it. Any ideas? Thanks.,2021-04-29 19:16:09,"I think I found the fix. Run the optimiser in mobile app, ringing disappeared.",2023-03-16 11:47:07,After
