SonyHeadphones,WH-1000XM4 High Pitched Noise in Left Ear Cup When Partially Lifted,I just got the Sony WH-1000XM4 headphones today and I get a super loud high pitched tinnitus like noise when the left ear cup is partially lifted. So as I’m putting them on/taking off I get this. If I break the seal and slightly lift the left ear cup I get it. Any ideas? Thanks.,2021-04-29 19:16:09,[https://youtu.be/20v788Xb9vQ](https://youtu.be/20v788Xb9vQ) This fix the problem completely!,2023-02-17 18:57:48,Before

It is the internal microphone that is right in the middle of the driver, it is a small metallic cylinder, it occurred to me to try changing the microphone from the right to the left and indeed the problem is the microphone, try to clean it with a brush but maybe it will damage it a little more, it no longer makes the annoying high pitched sound but the ANC It sounds very strange, I'll find a way to get a new microphone",2023-02-24 01:05:27,Before

will have to open it one day and check if there is any sort of mic hanging around... will add details if that is the case and the suggested fix works",2023-02-24 04:44:29,Before
